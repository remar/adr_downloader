ADR Downloader
==============

This simple program will download the complete archive of
[thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com](http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com)
and store it as minimal HTML files.

It uses Python 3, so you will need to [install that
first](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Simply run
adr_downloader.py to have it download all the posts and store them in
the data/html folder.
