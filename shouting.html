I've been trying for some time now to understand the
reaction of Hillary Clinton&#8217;s supporters to her defeat in last week&#8217;s election.
At first, I simply dismissed it as another round of the amateur theatrics both
parties indulge in whenever they lose the White House. Back in 2008, as most of
my readers will doubtless recall, Barack Obama&#8217;s victory was followed by months
of shrieking from Republicans, who insisted&#8212;just as a good many Democrats are
insisting today&#8212;that the election of the other guy meant that democracy had
failed, the United States and the world were doomed, and the supporters of the
losing party would be rounded up and sent to concentration camps any day now. </div>
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
That sort of histrionic nonsense has been going on for decades.
In 2000, Democrats chewed the scenery in the grand style when George W. Bush
was elected president. In 1992, it was the GOP&#8217;s turn&#8212;I still have somewhere a
pamphlet that was circulated by Republicans after the election containing
helpful phrases in Russian, so that American citizens would have at least a
little preparation when Bill Clinton ran the country into the ground and handed
the remains over to the Soviet Union. American politics and popular culture
being what it is, this kind of collective hissy fit is probably unavoidable. </div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
Fans of irony have much to savor. You&#8217;ve got people who were
talking eagerly about how to game the electoral college two weeks ago, who now
are denouncing the electoral college root and branch; you&#8217;ve got people who
insisted that Trump, once he lost, should concede and shut up, who are
demonstrating a distinct unwillingness to follow their own advice. You&#8217;ve got
people in the bluest of blue left coast cities marching in protest as though
that&#8217;s going to change a single blessed thing&#8212;as I&#8217;ve pointed out <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/12/consuming-democracy.html">in
previous posts here</a>, protest marches that aren&#8217;t backed up with
effective grassroots political organization are simply a somewhat noisy form of
aerobic exercise. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Still, there&#8217;s more going on here than that. I know some
fairly thoughtful people whose reaction to the election&#8217;s outcome wasn&#8217;t
histrionic at all&#8212;it consisted of various degrees of shock, disorientation, and
fear. They felt, if the ones I read are typical, that the people who voted for
Trump were deliberately rejecting and threatening them personally. That&#8217;s
something we ought to talk about. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
To some extent, to be sure, this was a reflection of the
political culture of personal demonization I discussed in last week&#8217;s post.
Many of Clinton&#8217;s supporters convinced themselves, with the help of a great
deal of propaganda from the Democratic Party and its bedfellows in the
mainstream media, that Donald Trump is a monster of depravity thirsting for
their destruction, and anyone who supports him must hate everything good. Now
they&#8217;re cringing before the bogeyman they imagined, certain that it&#8217;s going to
act out the role they assigned it and gobble them up. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Another factor at work here is the very strong tendency of
people on the leftward end of American politics to believe in what I&#8217;ve
elsewhere called the religion of progress&#8212;the faith that history has an
inherent tilt toward improvement, and more to the point, toward the particular kinds
of improvement they prefer. Hillary Clinton, in an impromptu response to a
heckler at one of her campaign appearances, phrased the central tenet of that
religion concisely: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to go back. We&#8217;re going to go forward.&#8221;
Like Clinton herself, a great many of her followers saw their cause as another
step forward in the direction of progress, and to find themselves &#8220;going back&#8221;
is profoundly disorienting&#8212;even though those labels &#8220;forward&#8221; and &#8220;back&#8221; are
entirely arbitrary when they aren&#8217;t the most crassly manipulative sort of
propaganda. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
That said, there&#8217;s another factor driving the reaction of
Clinton&#8217;s supporters, and the best way I can find to approach it is to consider
one of the more thoughtful responses from that side of the political landscape,
an incisive essay posted to Livejournal last week by someone who goes by the
nom de Web &#8220;Ferrett Steinmetz.&#8221; The essay&#8217;s titled <a href="http://theferrett.livejournal.com/2085448.html" target="_blank">The Cold, Cold Math We&#8217;ll Need to Survive the Next Twenty Years</a>, and it comes
so close to understanding what happened last Tuesday that the remaining gap
offers an unsparing glimpse straight to the heart of the failure of the Left to
make its case to the rest of the American people. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
At the heart of the essay are two indisputable points. The
first is that the core constituencies of the Democratic Party are not large
enough by themselves to decide who gets to be president. That&#8217;s just as true of
the Republican party, by the way, and with few exceptions it&#8217;s true in every
democratic society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each party large
enough to matter has a set of core constituencies who can be counted on to vote
for it under most circumstances, and then has to figure out how to appeal to
enough people outside its own base to win elections. That&#8217;s something that both
parties in the US tend to forget from time to time, and when they do so, they
lose. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
The second indisputable point is that if Democrats want to
win an election in today&#8217;s America, they have to find ways to reach out to
people who don&#8217;t share the values and interests of the Left. It&#8217;s the way that
Ferrett Steinmetz frames that second point, though, that shows why the
Democratic Party failed to accomplish that necessary task this time. &#8220;We have
to reach out to people who hate us,&#8221; Steinmetz says, and admits that he has no
idea at all how to do that. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Let&#8217;s take those two assertions one at a time. First, do the
people who voted for Donald Trump in this election actually hate Ferrett
Steinmetz and his readers&#8212;or for that matter, women, people of color, sexual
minorities, and so on? Second, how can Steinmetz and his readers reach out to
these supposedly hateful people and get them to vote for Democratic candidates?
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
I have no idea whether Ferrett Steinmetz knows anybody who
voted for Donald Trump.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I suspect he
doesn&#8217;t&#8212;or at least, given the number of people I&#8217;ve heard from who&#8217;ve
privately admitted that they voted for Trump but would never let their friends
know this, I suspect he doesn&#8217;t know anyone who he knows voted for Trump. Here
I have a certain advantage. Living in a down-at-the-heels mill town in the
north central Appalachians, I know quite a few people who supported Trump; I&#8217;ve
also heard from a very large number of Trump supporters by way of this blog,
and through a variety of other sources. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Are there people among the pro-Trump crowd who are in fact
racists, sexists, homophobes, and so on? Of course. I know a couple of
thoroughly bigoted racists who cast their votes for him, for example, including
at least one bona fide member of the Ku Klux Klan. The point I think the Left
tends to miss is that <i>not everyone in flyover country is like
that</i>. A few years back, in fact, a bunch of Klansmen came to the town
where I live to hold a recruitment rally, and the churches in town&#8212;white as
well as black&#8212;held a counter-rally, stood on the other side of the street, and
drowned the Klansmen out, singing hymns at the top of their lungs until the
guys in the white robes got back in their cars and drove away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Surprising? Not at all; in a great deal of
middle America, that&#8217;s par for the course these days. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
To understand why a town that ran off the Klan was a forest
of Trump signs in the recent election, it&#8217;s necessary to get past the
stereotypes and ask a simple question: why did people vote for Trump? I don&#8217;t
claim to have done a scientific survey, but these are the things I heard Trump
voters talking about in the months and weeks leading up to the election: </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>1. The Risk of War.</b> This was the most common point at
issue, especially among women&#8212;nearly all the women I know who voted for Trump,
in fact, cited it as either the decisive reason for their vote or one of the
top two or three. They listened to Hillary Clinton talk about imposing a no-fly
zone over Syria in the face of a heavily armed and determined Russian military
presence, and looked at the reckless enthusiasm for overthrowing governments
she&#8217;d displayed during her time as Secretary of State. They compared this to
Donald Trump&#8217;s advocacy of a less confrontational relationship with Russia, and
they decided that Trump was less likely to get the United States into a
shooting war. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
War isn&#8217;t an abstraction here in flyover country. Joining
the military is very nearly the only option young people here have if they want
a decent income, job training, and the prospect of a college education, and so
most families have at least one relative or close friend on active duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>People here respect the military, but the
last two decades of wars of choice in the Middle East have done a remarkably
good job of curing middle America of any fondness for military adventurism it
might have had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>While affluent feminists
swooned over the prospect of a woman taking on another traditionally masculine
role, and didn&#8217;t seem to care in the least that the role in question was
&#8220;warmonger,&#8221; a great many people in flyover country weighed the other issues
against the prospect of having a family member come home in a body bag. Since
the Clinton campaign did precisely nothing to reassure them on this point, they
voted for Trump. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>2. The Obamacare Disaster. </b>This was nearly as
influential as Clinton&#8217;s reckless militarism. Most of the people I know who
voted for Trump make too much money to qualify for a significant federal
subsidy, and too little to be able to cover the endlessly rising cost of
insurance under the absurdly misnamed &#8220;Affordable Care Act.&#8221; They recalled,
rather too clearly for the electoral prospects of the Democrats, how Obama
assured them that the price of health insurance would go down, that they would
be able to keep their existing plans and doctors, and so on through all the
other broken promises that surrounded Obamacare before it took effect. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
It was bad enough that so few of those promises were kept.
The real deal-breaker, though, was the last round of double- or triple-digit
annual increase in premiums announced this November, on top of increases nearly
as drastic a year previously. Even among those who could still afford the new
premiums, the writing was on the wall: sooner or later, unless something changed,
a lot of people were going to have to choose between losing their health care
and being driven into destitution&#8212;and then there were the pundits who insisted
that everything would be fine, if only the penalties for not getting insurance
were raised to equal the cost of insurance! Faced with that, it&#8217;s not
surprising that a great many people went out and voted for the one candidate
who said he&#8217;d get rid of Obamacare. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>3. Bringing Back Jobs. </b>This is the most difficult one
for a lot of people on the Left to grasp, but that&#8217;s a measure of the gap
between the bicoastal enclaves where the Left&#8217;s policies are formed and the
hard realities of flyover country. Globalization and open borders sound great
when you don&#8217;t have to grapple with the economic consequences of shipping tens
of millions of manufacturing jobs overseas, on the one hand, and federal
policies that flood the labor market with illegal immigrants to drive down
wages, on the other. Those two policies, backed by both parties and surrounded
by a smokescreen of empty rhetoric about new jobs that somehow never managed to
show up, brought about the economic collapse of rural and small town America,
driving a vast number of Americans into destitution and misery. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Clinton&#8217;s campaign did a really inspired job of rehashing
every detail of the empty rhetoric just mentioned, and so gave people out here
in flyover country no reason to expect anything but more of the same downward
pressure on their incomes, their access to jobs, and the survival of their
communities. Trump, by contrast, promised to scrap or renegotiate the trade
agreements that played so large a role in encouraging offshoring of jobs, and
also promised to put an end to the tacit Federal encouragement of mass illegal
immigration that&#8217;s driven down wages. That was enough to get a good many voters
whose economic survival was on the line to cast their votes for Trump. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>4. Punishing the Democratic Party.</b> This one is a bit
of an outlier, because the people I know who cast votes for Trump for this
reason mostly represented a different demographic from the norm out here:
young, politically liberal, and incensed by the way that the Democratic
National Committee rigged the nomination process to favor Clinton and shut out
Bernie Sanders. They believed that if the campaign for the Democratic
nomination had been conducted fairly, Sanders would have been the nominee, and
they also believe that Sanders would have stomped Trump in the general
election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For what it&#8217;s worth, I think
they&#8217;re right on both counts. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
These voters pointed out to me, often with some heat, that
the policies Hillary Clinton supported in her time as senator and secretary of
state were all but indistinguishable from those of George W. Bush&#8212;you know, the
policies Democrats denounced so forcefully a little more than eight years
ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They argued that voting for Clinton
in the general election when she&#8217;d been rammed down the throats of the
Democratic rank and file by the party&#8217;s oligarchy would have signaled the final
collapse of the party&#8217;s progressive wing into irrelevance. They were willing to
accept four years of a Republican in the White House to make it brutally clear
to the party hierarchy that the shenanigans that handed the nomination to
Clinton were more than they were willing to tolerate. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Those were the reasons I heard people mention when they
talked in my hearing about why they were voting for Donald Trump. They didn&#8217;t
talk about the issues that the media considered important&#8212;the email server
business, the on-again-off-again FBI investigation, and so on. Again, this
isn&#8217;t a scientific survey, but I found it interesting that not one Trump voter
I knew mentioned those. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
What&#8217;s more, hatred toward women, people of color, sexual
minorities, and the like weren&#8217;t among the reasons that people cited for voting
for Trump, either. Do a fair number of the people I&#8217;m discussing hold attitudes
that the Left considers racist, sexist, homophobic, or what have you? No
doubt&#8212;but the mere fact that such attitudes exist does not prove that those
attitudes, rather than the issues just listed, guided their votes. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
When I&#8217;ve pointed this out to people on the leftward side of
the political spectrum, the usual response has been to insist that, well, yes,
maybe Trump did address the issues that matter to people in flyover country,
but even so, it was utterly wrong of them to vote for a racist, sexist
homophobe! We&#8217;ll set aside for the moment the question of how far these labels
actually apply to Trump, and how much they&#8217;re the product of demonizing
rhetoric on the part of his political enemies on both sides of the partisan
divide. Even accepting the truth of these accusations, what the line of
argument just cited claims is that people in the flyover states should have
ignored the issues that affect their own lives, and should have voted instead
for the issues that liberals think are important. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
In some idyllic Utopian world, maybe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the real world, that&#8217;s not going to
happen. People are not going to embrace the current agenda of the American Left
if doing so means that they can expect their medical insurance to double in
price every couple of years, their wages to continue lurching downward, their
communities to sink further in a death spiral of economic collapse, and their
kids to come home in body bags from yet another pointless war in the Middle
East. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Thus there&#8217;s a straightforward answer to both of Ferrett
Steinmetz&#8217; baffled questions. Do the people who voted for Trump hate Steinmetz,
his readers, or the various groups&#8212;women, people of color, sexual minorities&#8212;whose
concerns are central to the politics of today&#8217;s American Left? In many cases,
not at all, and in most others, not to any degree that matters politically.
They simply don&#8217;t care that much about the concerns that the Left considers
central&#8212;especially when those are weighed against the issues that directly
affect their own lives.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
As for what Ferrett Steinmetz&#8217;s side of the political
landscape can offer the people who voted for Trump, that&#8217;s at least as simple
to answer: listen to those voters, and they&#8217;ll tell you. To judge by what I&#8217;ve
heard them say, they want a less monomaniacally interventionist foreign policy
and an end to the endless spiral of wars of choice in the Middle East; they
want health insurance that provides reasonable benefits at a price they can
afford; they want an end to trade agreements that ship American jobs overseas,
and changes to immigration policy that stop the systematic importation of
illegal immigrants by big corporate interests to drive down wages and benefits;
and they want a means of choosing candidates that actually reflects the will of
the people. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
The fascinating thing is, of course, that these are things
the Democratic Party used to offer. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago, in fact, that the
Democratic Party made exactly these issues&#8212;opposition to reckless military
adventurism, government programs that improved the standard of living of
working class Americans, and a politics of transparency and integrity&#8212;central
not only to its platform but to the legislation its congresspeople fought to
get passed and its presidents signed into law. Back when that was the case, by
the way, the Democratic Party was the majority party in this country, not only
in Congress but also in terms of state governorships and legislatures. As the
party backed away from offering those things, it lost its majority position.
While correlation doesn&#8217;t prove causation, I think that in this case a definite
case can be made. </div>
<br />More generally, if the Left wants to get the people who voted for Trump to vote for them instead, they&#8217;re going to have to address the issues that convinced those voters to cast their ballots the way they did. Oh, and by the way, listening to what the voters in question have to say, rather than loudly insisting that they can only be motivated by hatred, would also help quite a bit. That may be a lot to ask, but once the shouting stops, I hope it&#8217;s a possibility. </div>

What a clear and focused analysis of the situation. A lot of my friends were shocked by Trump winning, most didn&#39;t vote for Clinton, but still expected her to win. Many of my queer and poc friends are very scared.  <br /><br />In other news, my band just put out our new album. The writing is definitely inspired in part by my dreading of this blog. It&#39;s called &quot;Apocalyptic Dreams&quot; and can be downloaded at thehillsandtherivers.bandcamp.com.

An early and excellent essay, I think. Good points, but I know people who voted for Trump that insisted that Clinton was a Criminal, that we needed a &quot;Change,&quot; and that Climate change is not real.<br />So some of the tar smeared on Clinton did stick. I also believe that the strange words from Comey DID have a last-minute effect on some people&#8212;maybe even enough people.<br />I would agree that had Sanders won the nomination he would have buried Trump. His personal integrity was never in question, he had no e-mail issues. But more important, his message appealed to many of the same groups of people that Trump&#39;s message did. He did not like Obamacare as it exists, he was against the endless wars, and definitely against the constant removal of taxes on the wealthier classes and pandering to large corporations. So I believe that his message would have appealed to both the coastal elites and the interior have-nots.<br />But we have a lot of politicians who care only for their own jobs and they control the parties. <br />Open primaries, elimination of gerrymandering and term limitations would go a long way to open up the political landscape of this country. But what do I know? I vote and no one I talk to wants to hear what I say anyway. Cheers, WES<br />

Totally agree, and let us hope that Elizabeth Warren or whoever is anointed by the DNC next time will actually listen to the people. Even Howard Dean, in his bid to regain the chairmanship, seems to agree in a recent interview by NPR. After 4 years of DT failing to bring back the promised jobs and deliver truly affordable healthcare, the people will once again be looking for REAL change next time. They better be ready to deliver, and do so soon, or there will be hell to be paid.

Under normal circumstances, Archdruid, I&#39;d be agreeing with you wholeheartedly. These aren&#39;t normal circumstances, however, and I speak as a confirmed Sanders supporter who only reluctantly filled in the dot for HRC. At the risk of invoking Godwin&#39;s Law, I would point out that most of those who voted for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in 1932 liked his promises to bring back jobs, strengthen the military, roll back immigration, and so on.  (He lost the popular vote anyway, and was &quot;appointed&quot; Chancellor the next spring, if you recall.) If I read history correctly, HWMNBN didn&#39;t beat the anti-Semitic drum loudly until 1939, and by that time the deal was sealed. Those German voters weren&#39;t monsters either, but they got a heckuva lot more than they--or the world--bargained for. [http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/courses/290h_09/readings/koonz.pdf] Marx bores me to tears, but that line about &quot;first as tragedy, second as farce&quot; seems prescient now. I hope we&#39;re all still laughing in four years.

Indeed, the irony is plentiful with this election, results, and aftermath.  And while I agree with your analysis of the hows and whys, I can&#39;t help but feel this past election, the candidates, the platforms and the results haven&#39;t been some sort of mad scientist&#39;s psychological experiment to see how far the voters can be stressed before they shrug and become non-participants.<br /><br />Due to the ongoing Long Descent in which Trump and the rest of us are mostly helpless, I fully expect the Dems to be motivated and organized for the 2020 election, which should see the Left/Socialists crush the opposition and usher in a new age of wealth redistribution.  As a positive net taxpayer and &quot;producer&quot;, it&#39;s motivating me to retire/collapse early.<br /><br />

Greetings- I believe you give the Ferrett blog too much credit. Trump had significantly less votes than Romney in 2012; it was the collapse in Democrats voting that put Trump in power. <br /><br />You explain - correctly, I believe - why rural American voted for Trump, but Democrat have to look at why their own party members just didn&#39;t bother to vote. Ferrett doesn&#39;t talk about that. Outsiders can point at Clinton&#39;s failures, but the DNC needs to wake up and take a hard look at how it made the decision to run a candidate that lost to Obama in 2008 and would have lost to Sanders in a fair fight in 2012. I suspect the decision was made because the Clinton&#39;s effectively run the DNC, but that&#39;s also a party failure. The DNC needs to get its own house in order first. My advice would be to start by actually trying democracy. <br /><br />And congratulations on calling the election!<br /><br />-Dave

JMG - Thanks for keeping the clarity going. I voted for Trump for the exact reason that I dislike Hillary Clinton, her track record, and what she stands for - as you&#39;ve pointed out. I live in Massachusetts, a very blue state indeed. I am a college educated white male and my best friend is black. I have none of the tendencies that Clinton supporters have described people like me as having. I chose a different candidate and they&#39;re appalled that I &quot;support&quot; his racist, homophobic, and mysoginistic tendencies. I don&#39;t. Not at all. I just don&#39;t believe they matter as much as the other ideas he has for the country. That and he&#39;s 70 years old. If his life was that bad we&#39;d have heard a lot more about it in years past, wouldn&#39;t we?<br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;d like to offer another perspective that certainly aligns with what you are saying here. The creator of the Dilbert cartoon, Scott Adams, has done much work to frame this as a case of persuasion and hypnosis by both sides. He offers an entertaining and thoughtful analysis from that school of thought. We just have to wake the country up from it&#39;s cognitive dissonance.

Another deft and dazzling piece.<br /><br />One of the things I love about your essays is your habit of presenting both sides.  It&#39;s much easier for me to be still and listen thoughtfully to &quot;the other side&quot; when I feel that &quot;my side&quot; is given airtime too.  I can&#39;t think of a time when you didn&#39;t present the merits of a point of view with which you happen to disagree.  Besides, I derive a degree of calmness and peace from reading well-written thoughts.<br /><br />

Stimulating as ever. Thank you.<br /><br />On Ferrett Steinmetz:<br /><br />https://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/brand-dear-daughter-i-hope-you-have-awesome-sex/<br /><br />The type is common. I had a run-in with just such a &quot;liberal&quot; in a dispute with my then employer about 5 years ago. Will spare you details.

John--<br /><br />One interesting experience I had, which I thought also provided commentary on the election generally, occurred on Election Day.  I had voted weeks earlier, as soon as the Wisconsin early voting window had opened (no new data was going to alter the fundamental decision I&#39;d come to and I wanted to get on with my life) -- in fact, I was told by the clerk at city hall that mine was the first ballot cast int he city -- but my wife had decided to vote in person as was her habit.  She texted me that morning to say that she had decided not to vote.  My manager swung by my office in the early afternoon, having gone to vote during lunch, and commented on the lack of any line at his polling station.  Then, he offhandedly remarked that his wife had decided that morning to not vote.  I looked at him and said, &quot;Interesting, because that is exactly what my wife said as well.&quot;  Anecdotal, but a fascinating synchronicity.<br /><br />Your points are well-made.  The left appears to me to be bewildered, disoriented, and confused by the &quot;impossible&quot; outcome.  Is it enough to re-establish a working class focus and jettison the neoliberal axioms they&#39;d adopted?  I don&#39;t know.  If they do not, then the party of Jefferson will run out of lives and a new coalition will take its place.  (The claim of continuity is tenuous at best, but it is there.)  Will Trump actually be able to govern in any substantial way contrary to core Republican philosophy?  I don&#39;t know there, either.  I hope he is able to put some of his better ideas into action.  If both of the major parties maintain the same old patterns, we are priming ourselves for some serious unpleasantness.

Lately, my experience has been that trying to make these arguments is likely to get me labeled with all the preferred epithets being directed at the Trump supporters themselves. Basically the idea seems to be that if you&#39;re not denouncing Trump supporters with all your might, you must share their views. Interestingly enough, the arguments you&#39;ve been making have finally started to work their way into the mainstream conversation, but they don&#39;t last very long once they&#39;re there, getting quickly shot down with pieces like this one that reads like a parody of of itself: http://forsetti.tumblr.com/post/153181757500/on-rural-america-understanding-isnt-the-problem. Choice quote: &quot;The real problem isn&#8217;t east coast elites don&#8217;t understand or care about rural America.  The real problem is rural America doesn&#8217;t understand the causes of their own situations and fears and they have shown no interest in finding out.  They don&#8217;t want to know why they feel the way they do or why they are struggling because the don&#8217;t want to admit it is in large part because of choices they&#8217;ve made and horrible things they&#8217;ve allowed themselves to believe.&quot; (I&#39;m surprised the phrase &quot;evilly evil for evil&#39;s sake&quot; didn&#39;t show up in there completely unironically at some point). And of course, if the narrative of the left can&#39;t be salvaged and turned into something that can actually speak to the people outside its bubble, then Trump will be the voice of the future for a very long time.

I hear what you&#39;re saying... I am seeing how off base most of the reactions against Trump have been, and have been trying to speak out in defense of the policies I think Trump has put forward that could actually push things in a positive direction, and I considered Trump several times over the course of this election before finally voting third party (and thanking my lucky stars that Maryland is not a state where my presidential vote was ever going to weigh that heavily). However, some things that I am distinctly concerned about with Trump&#39;s America and what it could become, I keep wanting to think that it is just the bubble of shouting that&#39;s saying it, but I just can&#39;t completely let go of them.<br /><br />The first is the possibility of some sort of internment, ID programs, and tracking of American Muslims, which rankles me on a deep and visceral level for a variety of reasons. I have yet to see Trump say anything that has assured me that such possibilities are off the table, and what I&#39;ve seen from him regarding Muslims has mostly been extreme statements that he&#39;s quickly backed down from. It wouldn&#39;t have to be a holocaust to be a dark period in American history, and America has done things like that plenty of times over the years. <br /><br />The second is the specific nature of his rhetoric surrounding immigration... my views on immigration completely shifted when I saw how the agricultural industry treated migrant workers (between employing child labor, skirting basic workplace safety laws, and cramming workers into inhumane working conditions)... but at the same time, Trump seems to be placing most of the blame on the migrant workers themselves and making them the targets, rather than targeting an agricultural industry that uses illegal immigration as an excuse to cut costs by getting away with slave labor while the political establishment looks the other way. It really seems to me that the target should be companies like Phillip Morris that depend on illegal immigration to cut costs, rather than on innocent people and their families, and by targeting Mexican immigrants specifically, I am definitely worried about what is going to happen (especially having grown up in Texas as the son of a bilingual teacher and therefore having spent a huge part of my childhood around those very communities.)<br /><br />The other is the things that have been done in Trump&#39;s name since he&#39;s been elected (Trump may have come out in support of the LGBT community, but there are definitely Trump fans who haven&#39;t gotten that message yet)... I was heartened to see Trump speak out against those behaviors, but it could still easily get out of his hands... and the political violence from the other side points towards an America that has the potential of becoming extremely unsafe without any regard for the policies Trump actually puts forward.<br /><br />So I am still concerned about the near future. I think Trump can get some helpful things done, but there are possibilities lurking in the corner of my mind that feel a little more tangible than the panic that comes out of the media circus&#8230; the biggest question I&#8217;ve been asking, and trying to figure out especially in the midst of all the shouting is: if you&#8217;re wrong&#8230; if Trump is the exact push towards American totalitarianism that you&#8217;ve warned about in the past (and in some cases such as the character profile in Strange Bright Banners even in ways that sound almost exactly like him)&#8230; what is the line he&#8217;d have to cross before you&#8217;d shift your attitudes? I&#8217;m watching him closely&#8230; but what would be the thing he&#8217;d have to do or say that would call for a reassessment of both his place in history, and the appropriate responses to him?<br />

Well that was a bull&#39;s eye, John! Or, as they would say in my neck of the woods; &quot;carton plein!&quot; ...believe it or not, the French do not have a word for the bull&#39;s eye, they just call it the centre of the taget.

JMG,<br /><br />Thanks as usual for a thoughtful article.<br /><br />My sense here is that this election was the Democrats&#39; to lose -- and they did.  The final nail in the coffin was Hillary&#39;s now-notorious &quot;deplorables&quot; comment.  What an imbecilic thing to say!  Insulting your opponent in a political campaign is par for the course, but insulting your opponent&#39;s supporters just guarantees that they will turn out in droves to vote against you.<br /><br />Furthermore, it indicates that you&#39;re unfit to serve as president.  One thing the rank-and-file of whatever stripe wants when the dust settles is a government that is fair, just, and weighs everyone&#39;s interests when pursuing its policies.  Making comments that indicate contempt for half the population can alienate even your own now-erstwhile supporters.<br /><br />Not to mention creating backlash among the insulted.  These folks are now looking for payback.  Your &quot;fairly thoughtful&quot; acquaintances who felt that &quot;the people who voted for Trump were deliberately rejecting and threatening them personally&quot; may not be that far off the mark.  From theburningplatform.com (once a conservative yet insightful -- but now an overtly right-wing -- financial and social blog) in an article the day after the election: &quot;[P]ut on a happy face my special snow flakes because regardless of whoever/whatever you are and regardless of what nation it is you reside in, we, the deplorables, are coming for you.&quot;  In case there was any doubt about what &quot;coming for you&quot; might mean, the article was headed by a picture of a phalanx of warriors with the caption &quot;Deplorables Regrouping For The Next Attack&quot;, and concluded with another warrior picture with the inscription &quot;Give then NOTHING.  Take from them EVERYTHING.&quot;<br /><br />These kind of sentiments are the wages of the politics of division.  Both sides indulged in it, and as far as I can tell, they still are.  But Hillary made it personal.  Not good when you&#39;re running for President. <br /><br />https://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15f13bfda87b4837b55fbe9fce6c5c3e.jpg

I think the narrative that Democrats seem to be favouring now is &quot;Hillary Won The Popular Vote.&quot;  This seems to be the equivalent of the narrative that &quot;Leave voters were lied to&quot; after the EU referendum here in the UK.<br /><br />So I think that there won&#39;t be any serious reflection in the Democratic party.  I think they believe that they only lost because Donald Trump won a narrow majority in a handful of states, and this itself was because of the Democrats&#39; own complacency in believing the polls, voter suppression through voter ID laws, insufficient effort to get the Democrat vote out, and the late intervention by Comey.  Which means that I&#39;m pretty sure that the DNC will come to the conclusion that they only lost due to tactics, and not to strategy.<br /><br />In turn, I think such a conclusion is essentially comforting.  Like the liberals who backed the Remain campaign in the UK, I think US liberals are now so used to getting their own way, and feel they are so advanced in promulgating their programme, that even a small step back, or a slight change of tack, is unacceptable to them.  Just as the Leave vote has not been accepted, nor will the Trump presidency.  After the initial shock and panic, and the consequent apocalyptic ramblings, US liberals, like their British equivalents, will start to regroup, and see Trump, like Brexit, as a temporary aberration in the long march of progress.  The psychology of previous investment plays a big part here.<br /><br />So I expect the Democrats to pursue exactly the same strategy during the next election, only with more scepticism towards the polls, greater energy in getting their voters out, and they might select a candidate with a bit less baggage.  Here in the UK, liberals will continue to attempt to stretch out the process of leaving the EU, in the hope that it might be permanently postponed or mired in constitutional wrangling.<br /><br />All of this I consider to be terrifically dangerous, but the last three decades of continual liberal/centre-left success has habituated them to getting their own way, and they are no longer capable of displaying the slightest humility or learning the most elementary political lessons.

Thanks JMG. The surge of hot air from the liberal pundits, who are baffled by how this could have happened, claiming the result was due to &quot;inchoate&quot; bigoted hatred and desire for change, for example, could lift a fleet of airships. it reminds me of nothing so much as how it felt to be an Occupier in Los Angeles back in the day, with the media reporting that we had no idea what we wanted. Well, we actually did know what we wanted, and were ready to set the record straight as soon as the media and pundits stopped bloviating for half a second to listen to us. Which, of course, they never did.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think racism / sexism / other isms are binary things, they exist on a spectrum. Liberals (of which I am one) have their own isms to greater or lesser degrees. You make a good point that a lot of Trump supporters may have had some degrees of one or more isms, but that they also had valid reasons for voting how they did, which were in most cases likely much more relevant. I sincerely hope that both sides can start listening to each other a bit and working together to make a better America and better world, although I&#39;m not holding my breath on that. I think that there are mostly mostly-good people on both sides, though perhaps not a single perfect person on either side. I just wish humans were a bit better at empathizing and communicating than we apparently are.<br /><br />I do feel compelled to point out, though, that W. was not &quot;elected president&quot; in 2000. Or did I miss something? Seems unlike you to make a mistake like that.

As always, nail meet the hammer known as JMG.  You, of course, were joined by Dave Wong, Michael Moore, Ferrett, Gleen Greenwald and many others that &quot;saw this coming.&quot;<br /><br />As far as the protests, they will die down once those that wanted anyone but Trump have had their cathartic moment.  They may get stuck in the 2nd stage (Anger) of grieving for a couple of weeks but eventually, they will move on through to stage 4, Depression (Stage 3, Bargaining, being skipped over).  At some point, acceptance will sink in and they will have to pick themselves up off the floor and get on with their life.  It doesn&#39;t mean that <br /><br />That all said, and all that you said, it&#39;s not going to matter if lefties swallow their pride and humbly prostrate before the flyover leftovers in this country that voted for DT, and ask for their forgiveness and offer their help.  Setting aside the war issue, growth is never, ever, EVER coming back.  Jobs and growth are not coming back.  <br /><br />This is what bothers me the most about all the hand wringing over DT being the president.  We are so focused on the moment and our &quot;feelings&quot; that we forget about the Dark Age America, Long Emergency and Long Descent that still heading towards and will not stop!  <br /><br />We can shut the borders and deport all we want.  We can slap massive tariffs on products coming into this country.  We can spend like there is no tomorrow and rebuild all kinds of infrastructure in this country.  But, as you have and many others have pointed out, without growth in energy (aka fossil fuels), there is no growth in the economy (aka GDP or whatever metric you want to measure growth by). <br /><br />In 1972, when we were &quot;temporarily&quot; taken off the gold standard, why did that really happen?  Look at the historical charts for US fossil fuel production and the increase in debt/credit from that time to now and it is clear that our cheap and easy to extract domestic oil (conventional) had peaked and we needed the &quot;freedom&quot; from the tether of the gold standard so we could print, print, print and buy, buy, buy, not only oil from overseas, but also &quot;growth.&quot;  <br /><br />Now that the Fed is stepping back from monetary policy - why do you think they have hemmed and hawed about raising rates, because they don&#39;t have any tools left in their toolbox that doesn&#39;t bring it all down - and letting government initiate plan B - aka fiscal stimulus (btw - both candidates want to unleash the fiscal printing press) - they will try to make America into the 1950&#39;s - 60&#39;s economic powerhouse we once were (aka great again), but it won&#39;t work.  <br /><br />By the time 2020 rolls around, it won&#39;t matter who is running for president, the slide will be gaining terminal velocity and everyone - left, right, center - will be as destitute and poor as the forgotten flyovers were.  We will all feel their pain and we will all wish we had listened to each other and cared for each other.<br />

This election was... something else. :) As a non straight, non Christian, I understand the fear. If I lived in the Bible belt, I would probably be worried, too, as any changes in federal laws protecting my minority set would, I imagine, revert the power to the state. Where I live, that&#39;s not a problem. Elsewhere, I don&#39;t know how deserved worrying would be. I probably need to get out more. I don&#39;t think that to-be-President Trump will actually care one way or another about who I&#39;m married to, or my non-Abrahamic religion, but I can see that members of his cabinet are a little more... scary. As for the protests, I fully agree with you. It is hypocritical, and a little desperate. The rules of the game were already laid out, they don&#39;t change because you lost. The vote is over. Trump will be president in 2017.<br />  For any of the social issues that may come with this president, I am hopeful he pulls through with some of the things he&#39;s promising. Some kind of reform for Obamacare (my family falls into that space of not enough money to rationalize spending that much for healthcare, but too much to get any assistance). Pulling back from meddling in the affairs of other countries. Focusing on strengthening our country. Bringing jobs back. In these, I am skeptical, but hopeful. May these things come about, with out minorities paying the price.<br />  And if he builds a wall, he better have a good idea about how it&#39;s going to be funded. I don&#39;t see Mexico saying &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. We should pay for it.&quot; <br /><br />   One thing I do cherish in his victory is watching the smug faces of the media talking heads that proclaimed Hillary the winner early on wondering, dismayed, &quot;What happened?&quot; Wednesday morning. It is a symptom of the echo chamber that many people of both sides create, walling out opinions other than their own. I have friends who were zealous for their chosen candidate on both sides. I would watch them unfriend people over who they were voting for. Most just complained about both options. In their bubble of chosen opinions, they had no sympathy for the thoughts of others. In their failure to try and understand the opposition, staunch Democrats heavily underestimated the strength of the support for Trump.<br /><br />  The DNC messed up on so many levels.

Wow, an early and a powerful installment.  Here in Vermont 6% wrote Bernie in, even though he was not officially on the ballot.  That&#39;s another way that Bernie supporters expressed their displeasure with the Democrats&#39; process and nominee.  I don&#39;t know how many did that in other states, but it may have helped Trump win in some.

JMG,<br />As usual, this is a good an analysis of current events as one is likely to find.  It is amazing to me the number of women (and men) who have told me their number one fear of Clinton was her endless warmongering.<br />As to the Bernie Sanders phenomenon, however, I have a different view of it now than I had at the beginning of the primaries.  As I have said here, I voted for Sanders in the primary, because I had decided long ago--I don&#39;t remember just when--that I would never cast a vote for Hillary Clinton.  The point is that there had to at least be the appearance of a contest on the Democrat side to balance the enormous attention that the Republicans were destined to get.<br />Hillary could not have sat there all those months and then presented herself for her coronation without being at a huge disadvantage vis a vis the Republican nominee, whoever that turned out to be.  Bernie was in on the fix of rounding out the message that Clinton wanted to present to the voters.  The enormous effort that Sanders put into the campaign is not balanced by the speed with which he threw in the towel and endorsed Clinton.<br />If Trump has any success at all, he will be reelected.  I just do not believe that the Democrats can &quot;right&quot; themselves in four years.<br />I am relieved that I already live on the edge of Retrotopia!

I agree with most of it, except the starting equivalency... not a good read of history, I think.<br /><br />But, yes, I voted for Trump, because Hillary was the same plutocratic rule continued.  And I agree on your points... they were my points.  And, Trump has flip-flopped so often, who knows where he&#39;ll eventually land.  And the histrionics over his caddish behavior were an insult to women in general, I think, and to the victims of real rape.<br /><br />Also, I think it is supposed to be a &#39;free&#39; country.. freedom to hate and despise and denigrate anyone you dislike ... barring personal injury. So we have to quite DEMANDING that they stop hating.  Who the heck do we think we are!?<br /><br />I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one member of a minority group, nor a single mother, nor a debt-burdened grad, etc. who wouldn&#39;t gladly &#39;give&#39; the haters their &#39;freedom&#39; in return for increasing economic security.  We may have been &#39;played&#39; by the Dem/Rep plutocracy...perhaps starting with the Dem swing away from economic justice to &#39;identity politics&#39; in the 60&#39;s?<br /><br />BTW, I don&#39;t think there IS a &#39;left&#39; anymore ... the first Clinton killed it.  The only shred I see is Bernie&#39;s three priorities:  1) rigged economy 2) Wall Street criminals 3 Washington corruption.  Let&#39;s make these the rallying cry of &#39;our&#39; party ... and see what kind of &#39;cross over&#39; appeal it has :)<br /><br />

I have thought for a long time that 18 months of campaigning is just too long. It wears the voters out after awhile hearing the same old accusations from each candidate about the others. This campaign wasnt really about the issues, it was a boxing match of character assassination.<br />I think maybe 3 or 4 months would be plenty sufficient for the candidates to express publicly what their understanding of the issues are and what they propose to do about it. There wouldnt be time to drag everyone through the mud. There would be plenty of time for the issues and maybe a couple of debates devoid of &quot;he said, she said.&quot; Maybe along with term limits we should also consider campaign time limits.<br />Great post. Keep up the good work.

Archdruid,<br /><br />As a Wisconsinite this speaks to me. I live in flyover country, even though Madison doesn&#39;t consider itself flyover, we&#39;re a small enclave in a sea of forgotten misery. That misery is edging into our bubble, we&#39;ve lost our biggest factory and are now wholly supported by the government, university, epic systems, and a smattering of smaller companies. I don&#39;t know where we will be when the economic bubble bursts, but it won&#39;t be any place good. <br /><br />The Dems don&#39;t speak to me anymore, and the left-wing seems totally lost in it&#8217;s identity politics. The left-wing cannot succeed when it&#8217;s dominated by the coastal cities who don&#8217;t understand the economic realities of flyover country. We need a leftist ideology rooted in class identity, a left leg instead of a left-wing. We&#8217;re not going to get it if we don&#8217;t build it ourselves. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Varun

I really love your take on things.  I was horrified when I found out Trump was elected because I thought that Hillary was by far the better debater.  Her take on world affairs was so much more sophisticated, but it also reminded me of the Ross Perot days when the election cycle was disrupted by non-professionals who seemed to nevertheless have a hand on the pulse of true american sentiment.  I don&#39;t agree however that many of those voting for Trump did so for less than savory reasons, and that they were a negligible percentage of the population.  Trump does come out as hateful with the wall rhetoric.  On the other hand, I completely agree that smart people in flyover country were tired of idle promises and that a long-shot would be better than no shot at all.

Hi John<br /><br />Great post - it will be difficult for left-wingers to adapt to actually listening to potential voters instead of lecturing them on what they should believe. Perhaps the experience of defeat will make some of them teachable

Well, things are heating up on Left Coast social media. A broad coalition of socialists, Berniecrats, freethinkers, and conservatives is attempting to point out all of the things you mention here to establishment liberals. The latter seem to be, for the most part, covering their ears and screaming the same five or six talking points that were endlessly recycled during the campaign. I&#39;ve seen people I respect post some really stupid things, and that&#39;s been much more of an unpleasant surprise to me than the election itself.<br />I think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned the Religion of Progress. This is nothing less than a crisis of faith for many, especially my fellow millennials, who came to political consciousness during the Bush years and have seen a lot of social progress under Obama. They&#39;re definitely disoriented, but most remain unaware of the economic and thermodynamic forces eating away at the system from the bottom up. <br />Finding a way to decouple liberal social values from runaway technotopian fantasties seems like the essential project here, but I&#39;m not sure where to find the people who would be willing to put together a Use Less Party. I think my problem is that they&#39;re already out there using less, and here I am on my smartphone...

Wait, what, people voting for their own interests?  Quelle horreur!  <br /><br />Your analysis is spot on.  The number of pundits flailing around trying to explain the vote is quite hilarious.  I&#39;ve even seen some trying to deny that one of the main reasons people voted for Trump was economic, i.e., jobs.  The economy is doing so well, don&#39;t ya know.  Average wages went up by 5.2% last month and the unemployment rate is down to 4.8%.  HA!  Ignoring that wages have been stagnant for the past 40 years, and the unemployment rate is down because of the number of people who have dropped out of the labor force and, therefore aren&#39;t counted.  The almost willful blindness of these supposed experts is just sad.<br /><br />By the way, I wouldn&#39;t consider the Democratic Party to be left-wing in any sense of the word.  Ever since Bill Clinton and the DLC, at least, they have been as corporatist and Wall Street oriented as the Republican Party, just a bit more egalitarian on the surface.

Brit TV personality &quot;Jonathan Pie&quot; sums it up rather neatly in this rant. Bottom line: HRC lost because the Left eschewed the art of persuasion, opting instead for insult. Caution: there&#39;s a lot of profanity.<br /><br />https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2nQIcjnMFQo

I think also fascinating is the reaction by interested parties outside of the US. I am a Canadian and I did not get a vote, neither did my baby-boomer mother, however she debated me sending me e-mail after e-mail, trying to change my mind because I thought Trump is a change for the better. Yes, I agree that Trump suffers from narcissistic personality disorder, but this is preferable to the other candidate who was quite probably a sociopath. Yes he is a womanizer, and part of the 1%, however at least he is open about it; that makes him authentic, and so forth.<br /><br />I went to the bookstore a couple of days later and bought his 1987 book, the art of the deal, and the people at this bookstore looked at me like I was weird or something. I said to the staff that I would have thought they would have had a 100 copies of the book on hand after the election result; instead the book was buried at the back of the store on the bottom shelf of the business section and I needed their help to find it. My daughter, also a Canadian who could not vote, came home going on about how 11/9 was the worst thing that happened to the world since 9/11. (She was 3 when 9/11 happened and I am sure she has no recollection of the event. The Alex Jones crowd was out immediately ridiculing anyone feeling this way, which is also an inappropriate reaction.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/fqm2HQQeHBg?t=1s<br /><br />Scott Adams had the most reasoned response saying that Trump was made out to be a monster, but as soon as he has a saving a cat in a tree moment, and acts in a way that a monster would not act, all the fuss will start to end. <br /><br />http://blog.dilbert.com/post/153172272041/how-to-break-an-illusion<br /><br />Great essay

I&#39;ve been puzzled a bit by the flip side of the post-election fervor.<br /><br />I see a lot of people who make cogent arguments about the macro-level decline and fall, and our near inevitable financial melt-down dancing in the end-zone the entirety of this week. <br /><br />Any prepping any one was doing should continue, if not be increased.<br /><br />1.  I don&#39;t think Trump has any real answer on banks.<br />2.  Trump&#39;s transition team and policy statements makes it clear that it will be full-steam ahead on using the planet as an open sewer (pun accepted).  Fracking will also intensify.<br />3.  Is there any indication that the infrastructure Trump proposes will be for anything other than car culture?<br />4.  The national debt.  It&#39;s a fair score-board.  Any doubt that it will dramatically increase under Trump?<br /><br />And, no, Hilary was no good on any of these.  But that&#39;s my point: if all of this stuff is going to be screwed up still, what is the point in acting like there is a triumph?<br /><br />I don&#39;t think 2016 was going to buy us much time, either way.  We, on an individual and community level, have a lot of work to do.

It is interesting how casually Ferrett makes the accusation of hate. Ironically the last time I remember hearing this was from the Republicans after the 9/11 attacks. They said in various forms that the terrorists hate us and our way of life. It was certainly an atrocity and fully radicalized terrorists perhaps do feel that way, but you have to think that decades of the US screwing around in their homeland might be more of a contributing factor than &quot;they hate us because they&#39;re racist and hate our culture&quot; -- which is essentially the accusation we see this week, except within the US.<br /><br />I expect that if you asked Ferrett whether he hates his political opponents he would say no. Hate is a dirty word on the Left and in general I think they fancy themselves as being above that kind of judgement by emotion. That&#39;s well and good but they then project that shadow on their conservative opponents where it&#39;s really not warranted. Still, his heart&#39;s in the right place and it&#39;s resonating with his readers so I am cautiously optimistic that useful reform of the Democrats may eventually occur.

JMG, <br /><br />Thank you! You&#39;ll be happy to know that I was on Irish television on election night, making some of the same points you did. The other panelists seemed like nice people, but were all political science experts, all predicted a Clinton win, and none offered much reason why anyone was voting for him. &quot;I guess a lot more Americans than we thought are racist,&quot; one told me afterwards. <br /><br />Also, I have written a piece saying many of these same things, hopefully to appear in a national magazine in the next few days. I&#39;ll send you a link when it&#39;s up, and I promise I wrote it before I read this. :-)

Interesting analysis, as usual. Although a Bernie backer from the beginning, I followed your analysis of Trump with interest, and even shared some of your political columns on social media with my politically mixed friends (no one listened until after the election).<br /><br />I came to the election a liberal, in most ways. I genuinely appreciated your analysis of Clinton&#39;s (and Obama&#39;s) flaws, and those posts changed me. I saw how my party had failed me. I voted for Clinton (Trump didn&#39;t reassure me on war, and he ignored the environment, my pet issue) - but I did so mentally composing my first of many planned letters to her giving her hell. I didn&#39;t give up on what I consider to be liberal values. Maybe, as you suggest, values like inclusiveness, tolerance, fairness and sharing responsibility for each other are part of the myth of progress and are doomed. I don&#39;t know, I guess I wouldn&#39;t want to live with the alternatives.<br /><br />I sat with my neighbor, watching the election results come in and saw the writing on the wall by 9PM. The next day, I couldn&#39;t look my kids in the eye while telling them Trump won. You see, they are little, and I am trying hard to raise them to be loving, kind and upright, not to bully others, you know. Clinton may not have been those things, but she praised them. And Trump didn&#39;t, really. My kids got that and they were pretty sad. Then I walked into work, glancing around knowing that pretty much everyone I worked with had voted Trump, mostly because these wealthy folks (we&#39;re physicians) wanted to save a buck on taxes. I got a lot of Mansplaining (?whitesplaining) that day, and in the days that followed, about how it would all be fine, what was I worried about?<br /><br />And yet of course it isn&#39;t necessarily fine. You&#39;ve said yourself it will be a bumpy road ahead. You&#39;ve opened my eyes to the genuine potential for the country to fracture along cultural lines, with civil war as things fall apart after peak oil. Remembering your tendency to look back at history, how could I overlook the parallels with the rise of Fascism in Europe? If not Trump, then maybe from those he has emboldened (wouldn&#39;t it be ironic if Trump avoided an international war but somehow provoked a civil one?). And of course, the people I find add so much to our conversation in America, immigrants (fascinating people!), women, minorities, LGTBQ, feel under threat. While I hear your comments about flyover country, please also remember that many of my kind of people were actively pushed out of it, to the coastal cities, by intolerance. In the past week, I&#39;ve seen so much anger from the right, people are really vicious. I posted something on Facebook telling people not to panic, to take a deep breath, and go out and make the world a kinder place. And I got roasted for it, accused of ignorance of Clinton&#39;s flaws and the usual ad hominem attacks. <br /><br />So yeah, I&#39;m pretty discouraged. I am more than ready to march in the streets for the rights of poor whites (and others) to better jobs, a fairer economy and a reformed political system. By all means, let&#39;s drain the swamp. I want a better system, jobs that aren&#39;t green-washing but are sustainable (not coal mining), Retrotopia. I think a lot of people are like me and are going to double down on their committments. What we don&#39;t have much use for are intolerance, anti-intellectualism and anger.<br /><br />I&#39;d be interested to hear how you think we can work with Trump to achieve Retrotopia. You seem to think he will improve things, and listen. What exactly would you say to him?<br /><br /><br />

You mention illegal immigration driving down wages as one reason many turned to Trump. Do you think that the cultural and demographic changes from massive immigration, both legal and illegal, are also a factor in Trump&#39;s win? How large a factor?

What is this Left you speak of? Do you mean the Left of minority identity politics? Well that aint left. I&#39;m surprised you have fallen into this rhetorical habit of calling what the Democratic party is doing &quot;Left&quot;. <br /><br />Not that anyone is doing Left anymore. If you can find the Left in the Communist Party run China do tell. <br /><br />I know I am doing JMG a little disservice here but these things need to be fleshed out.

Hi JMG,<br /><br />Yep. I&#39;ve been trying to have calm conversations with whomever I can in the aftermath of this election. Living now in, uh, Portland, let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m speaking primarily with Clinton supporters; if I&#39;ve spoken with any Trump ones, they haven&#39;t been forthright about it.<br /><br />It is a little bit crazy what a tightrope it feels like to talk about some of the issues you laid out here that I believe are behind Trump&#39;s win in a city that has to a certain degree plunged into fury, outrage, and disbelief. That&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration, mind you; the city is still moving right along, despite the protests, and I think people are slowly starting to get over it. But yeah, I can&#39;t bring myself to keep my mouth shut or to just go along with the &quot;Well, they&#39;re all just a bunch of racists, etc&quot; party line, and I&#39;ve been stepping very carefully in seeking out those who are willing to listen to a different, more honest narrative versus those who just want to lash out and rage against the world.<br /><br />The one thing I&#39;ll say, from here in the heart of a liberal city, is that I&#39;ve been able to find a surprising number of people who I&#39;ve been able to talk to honestly about this, and who are open to hearing the thought that voters were motivated more by honest and legitimate interests than outright hate. It&#39;s interesting, because in a number of conversations I feel like it bounces back and forth--there will be tentative agreement on class issues, but then a &quot;deplorables&quot; talking point (without actual use of that word) will pop right back in. I generally don&#39;t push too hard, but ease back into the alternate narrative, trying to coax out some alternate and less comfortable ways of viewing the world.<br /><br />I like to think I&#39;ve helped a tiny bit. There&#39;s a lot of fury out there, but I think there&#39;s a lot of hopeful receptivity. As the protests have gone on downtown, I&#39;ve opted to instead have conversations I hope are helpful and to survey the political landscape in the hopes of finding small openings for me to push the Democratic party toward a recognition of its failures and a willingness to fight for everyone with legitimate grievances, even when they&#39;re white or male or live in a rural area or say crass things, the way so many do. I hope maybe I&#39;m helping bridge the divide just a little.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to see what happens otherwise.<br /><br />Thank you for this essay. I&#39;ll look for people I can share it with, and I hope it catches on just as much, if not more, as the other essays you&#39;ve written about Trump and this election.<br /><br />Oh, and a double P.S. First of all, I&#39;ve been unveiling a deindustrial science fiction story on my Litterfall blog in recent weeks (amongst a bit of chatter on the election) and would encourage anyone who&#39;s interested to check out the <a href="http://figurationpress.com/ready-for-harvest-an-expected-chill/" rel="nofollow">first</a> and <a href="http://figurationpress.com/an-expected-chill-part-two/" rel="nofollow">second</a> installments. (Interestingly enough, it&#39;s set in Portland and features civil unrest.) Also, the <a href="https://intotheruins.com/issues/issue-3-fall-2016/" rel="nofollow">third issue</a> of <i>Into the Ruins</i> is now shipping to subscribers and is available for order. I just had a friend on Facebook comment that this is basically now nonfiction. Not yet, of course, but onward we slide down the slope of decline.

John Michael,<br /><br />Thank you for being a voice of reason and sanity in these crazy times. I have been forwarding your blog&#39;s recent posts to a lot of people I know to help them gain a better understanding of what is going on behind all the shouting, propaganda and vilification.<br /><br />I voted for Donald Trump because I saw him as being a better bet than Hillary Clinton. A major factor in that was Hillary&#39;s role as a shill for Wall Street and the rest of the status quo. I was disgusted in the extreme that the Obama administration did not prosecute a single Wall Street bankster for their outrageously and brazenly corrupt criminal conduct, conduct that very nearly brought about another global depression in 2008. As we all know, Hillary played a key role in President Obama&#39;s first turn, even if she wasn&#39;t directly involved in economic policy. She was certainly his designated successor and the last thing we needed was Obama&#39;s third term, which is what we would have gotten. I saw a vote for Hillary as a vote for the same ruinous status quo that is leading this country over a cliff. At least with Trump we have the possibility of reform, although I have no illusions about whether or not we will see enough changes in the right direction to matter. We will just have to wait and see. But at least the possibility of positive change and bringing American jobs back home is better than no hope at all.<br /><br />The disaster that is the Unaffordable Care Act was another issue that influenced my decision. I am currently insured through my employer, but as we all know, the predatory bipartisan consensus of the Republicrat and Dempublican parties has devastated the American labor market and who knows if I will continue to have a job that provides health insurance? I also have friends and relatives who have seen their insurance premiums skyrocket thanks to Obamacare, so that was another factor. The prospect of having to buy my own health insurance through the Obamacare system and either pay ridiculous and escalating rates with sky-high deductibles and co-pays or pay the fine and take my chances with no health insurance is a scary one, especially given the labor market that wage class Americans face these days.<br /><br />Finally, Hillary&#39;s incessant warmongering frankly scared me, as did the warmongering of her neocon buddies. Dmitry Orlov once wrote that the two scariest words in the English language are &quot;Victoria Nuland&quot; and I agree wholeheartedly, knowing about her track record with regards to Ukraine and Russia. As someone who comes from a military background and has friends and family who are still in the military, I am very much relieved we probably won&#39;t be going to war with Syria and/or Russia. <br /><br />I have friends and relatives who are still in uniform who breathed a sigh of relief when Trump won. Now they won&#39;t have to go fight in Syria or find out first-hand just how effective the anti-missile defenses and electronic countermeasures on our warships are against the latest Russian anti-ship missiles. I suspect a sizeable percentage of those missiles would get through and we would have a lot of good men and women going to meet Davy Jones in a hurry if that happened. All it would take is one or two P-270 Moskit, P-700 Granit or P-800 Oniks supersonic cruise missiles getting through to sink most warships. Anyone who doubts just how deadly these missiles are should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caqRJUFOMlA" rel="nofollow">video footage</a> from the Russian Navy of two P-800&#39;s being test fired.<br /><br />The revelations about Hillary&#39;s emails and the Clinton Foundation didn&#39;t play a very big role in my decision. For me, they just confirmed something I think most of us knew all along, that Trump&#39;s nickname for Hillary Clinton, Crooked Hillary, was very aptly chosen.

Steinmetz not only has no clue what the legitimate grievances of Trump voters are, he finds the very question imponderable.  Worse, he doesn&#8217;t seem to care; the point is simply to get a few of them to vote for his side - by fooling them, if necessary.<br /><br />Then there is the Democratic establishment, who made it very clear today that they have no intention of learning a lesson from last week&#8217;s debacle, by doubling down with the biggest Wall Street tool in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, for minority leader.<br /><br />If four or more years of a Trump administration results in the utter annihilation of the Democratic Party, and the creation of a new party dedicated to the constituency which it has betrayed, then liberals will have much to thank The Donald for, whether they will ever admit that or not.<br />

JMG,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been privileged to be in the same (large) room with Ferrett once or twice, and if a little intel helps you understand anything, he is a white male sci-fi author and househusband of a white female corporate lawyer, both in Hillary&#39;s favored 40-65 &quot;apres ma 401(k)&quot; constituency, and therefore his class interests are 200% in with bourgeois liberalism.  As such, it&#39;s deemed an exclusive right of his class to judge others as deserving or undeserving and to distribute the proceeds (ostensibly) accordingly.<br /><br />Ferrett is NO leftist.  Leftists want to unite the working class.  Liberals want to divide it.  He is as near as I have seen to the whole of neoliberalism in one sentient carbon-based life form.<br /><br />That said, there&#39;s a good case to be made from the Podesta Papers that the Democratic Party&#39;s primary was nothing more than a highly stage-managed reality show, with a predestined outcome.  Even Trump&#39;s free &quot;Pied Piper&quot; media blitz was a Democratic campaign strategy.  The Party&#39;s anti-Sanders &quot;socialist Jew&quot; strategy was drawn up by Democratic PR hack Mandy Grunwald.  There are also plenty of ads for protesters on Craigslist in major markets.  This whole election smells factory, not organic -- and people were voting against the source of the stench.<br /><br />Finally, I seem to recall in some comment on a thread long ago that you predicted a color revolution in the US right around now.  You predicted it would be Russia, but in fact, it&#39;s our perma-jilted Ukrainian friend Mr. Soros working on the homeland.  I&#39;m giving you full credit anyway; Anti-Russia is as good as when money&#39;s at stake.

JMG, interesting.  To echo someone else&#39;s comments, I would be interested in your perspective on why so many - despite all the sound and fury of this election season, less than 60% of eligible voters turned out.  Of course, some of that has to do with the blue/red state issue - although I would have voted for Trump if I were an American I don&#39;t care about his mandate - so for example I would have stayed home or voted 3rd party if I were in a blue state.<br /><br />Last weekend, I ate dinner with my family and another very salary-class family.  The attendant two-hours hate was... unpleasant.  The criticism of whatever rednecks are and their anger that white women somehow violated the sisterhood by voting for someone who at least promised to keep their fathers, husbands, brothers and sons home from war and employed in some sort of dignified capacity was repulsive.  I hate the culture I belong to and am incredibly pleased to see them finally experiencing cognitive dissonance.

<br />Hey ADJMG,<br /><br />Here is a fb post by a guy in Texas that teaches foraging. As far as I know he does not read your blog, but he sounds exactly like u.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Yarrow has been used around the world throughout time as a strong medicine used for everything from sword wounds to helping babies sleep. It&#39;s all over Texas right now so if your health insurance costs have skyrocketed like mine have you should probably harvest some for self-treatment.

JMG<br /><br />Excellent post as usual<br /><br />Thanks for the reference to Ferrett Steinmetz&#8217;s article.  As you say, he had some good points, but missed the real issues behind the election results.  Part of the problem is illustrated by the quote you used:  &#8220;We have to reach out to people who hate us.&#8221;  How do you have a conversation with someone you think hates you?  They&#8217;ll soon pick up on the underlying assumption and the discussion will probably sour.  This will only provide confirmation to the bias that these are &#8220;people who hate us.&#8221;  Until this fundamental perception of half of America changes, I don&#8217;t see them making much headway on convincing that half to vote the &#8220;proper&#8221; way.  <br /><br />I am inclined to believe that this year&#8217;s amateur theatrics are on the surface similar to the prior quadrennial hissy fits but different under the surface.  There are several things going on behind the mob in the streets.  <br /><br />First, many of the protests are seeded by non-profits providing ideology, manpower, funding, and logistics to whatever crowd is willing to be herded in the appropriate direction.  Want $15/hr?  Come protest the election with us.  While not a grassroots movement since it&#8217;s directed by the liberal elites, the protests can give the appearance of a grassroots movement that can be leveraged for both legitimacy and grounds for further social unrest.  This is similar to the playbook used in other nations for undermining and/or overthrowing governments.  <br /><br />Second, none of the Democratic leadership is speaking out against the protests.  Clinton certainly hasn&#8217;t, for many reasons.  If she and the Clinton Foundation want to remain a clearinghouse for party access and favors, she needs the Democratic base to see that the monster Trump stole the election, not that she lost it.  President Obama is electing to stay quiet even though he&#8217;s in the best spot to calm the waters without harming the Democratic Party.  Perhaps it&#8217;s his passive aggressive way of de-legitimizing the Trump Presidency, or maybe because he&#8217;s in on the liberal elite&#8217;s plan for further social unrest.  Their silence gives a certain tacit legitimacy to the protests and the underlying causes they represent.  <br /><br />Third, the mainstream media are doing their best to legitimize the protests as something more than a pity party.  Before this election, I would have passed it off as their normal underwhelming reporting.  However, the obvious bias and leading narratives displayed this last year are in the fore here as well.  Just watching the coverage made me believe they were given a sheet by the paid organizers as to which people to watch out for and what narratives to push.  No dissent or analytical thought allowed.<br /><br />These things point towards a future with more antagonistic partisanship, where public discourse is reduced to labels and expletives, and differences are manipulated to increase discord.  Very similar to what you said about a democracy in crisis.  <br /><br />I&#8217;m finding many similarities to the late &#8216;60s social protests, though they were truer grassroots movements than we have now.  Buffalo Springfield captured it in their song &#8220;For What Its Worth.&#8221;  One line I especially like: &#8220;A thousand people in the street/ Singing songs and carrying signs/ Mostly say, hooray for our side.&#8221;<br /><br />One last thing to ponder.  As president, Trump has no more power than Obama had.  Millions are afraid of what Trump will do, but none protested what Obama could do.  If the power in a position is only acceptable when the person who holds it is of like mind, then perhaps that position has too much power. <br />

Is it just me, or are the histrionics a bit worse this year? While I remember the apocalyptic muttering JMG talked about, I think this is the first time its escalated into protests and (arguably) mini-riots. Likewise, the sheer intensity of the anger against not only Trump, but everyone who voted for him (&quot;your vote was a hate crime&quot;? Good grief) and even people who voted 3rd party feels new. And I haven&#39;t even gotten to the BLM protests/riots, and the new trend of BLM motivated killings of police officers (two were shot in Des Moines a couple days before the election, but them Trump drowned the story out). Honestly, I think race relations have gotten worse since the 90&#39;s-00&#39;s-back them we managed to discuss race without rioting in the streets, and the SJW-style identity politics wasn&#39;t nearly as common. For America-or any society-to continue to exist as a whole, all its components have to have common values, common dreams, common history, common something to bind them together. Today, some parts of the right and large sections of the left seem to be trying to destroy that as much as possible. Sometimes, I wonder if my grandchildren will grow up under a red, white, and blue striped flag, and be able to drive to California without crossing an international border. I hope so.

JMG, when you called the election for Trump way back in January I shared it with the comment that I hoped you were wrong but your consistent record of clear and sober analysis could not be ignored. But you were right on election Tuesday and I took it pretty hard. But again, your clear and sober analysis (special thanks for the Ferret link) in the last two posts has helped me to back off and look at the whole thing from a more detached and more informed perspective. I think I&#39;m going to get over it way faster than my recovery from the Cleveland Indians loss in the World Series. Thanks.

I have to ask as well- Did the 16 years between Bill Clinton&#39;s administration and this election(including , of course, the GFC) shed any light on the fruits of offshore outsourcing and the mistaken belief that profits and prosperity are synonymous? In my travels over a fairly fixed set of routes over the last 25 years from western piedmont NC north thru central/eastern PA I have watched the step by step descent into distress. From my University days in the heyday of Bethlehem Steel, watching a 37000 man operation degenerate into the Sands Casino on the site of the Basic Oxygen Furnace, all I can say is that the air is a little cleaner, and the blue collar jobs that provided a launch pad for the middle class are much thinner on the ground. OTOH, the Amish and Mennonites are still keeping up appearances- or being the real preppers, just a few years early. <br />In the NW NC agricultural scene, the new spin on sustainable agriculture is still too heavily dependent on being the market garden for the nearest metro area. Asheville is probably the best example of a successful model, but they&#39;ve been at it for a long time.

New theory for why Clinton lost: fake news. http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/fake-news-facebook-google-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-wins-election.<br /><br />Both Facebook and Google are now taking steps to combat &quot;fake&quot; news. I wonder what else will be caught by this...

Hillary&#39;s e-mail mattered some to me, but more as a symptom of her &quot;inconvenient laws must not apply to me&quot; attitude. And that seems to generalize to the larger Democratic party. Not one banker in jail. Eric Holder sells guns to Mexican drug lords and gets to keep his job. John Corzine steals $1.6 billion from his own customers to cover euro-bond gambling losses, and isn&#39;t even indicted. It&#39;s all part of the pattern.  Say what you will about W, when Ken Lay called the White House while Enron was crumbling, W did not take the call, or intervene. Lay was indicted and convicted. <br /><br />The war-mongering was a big issue for me; I do wish the Republicans would throw McCain out of the party. I&#39;m tired of him too. <br /><br />And the Clinton&#39;s history on gun control isn&#39;t on your list, but it is most certainly on mine. <br /><br />Otherwise I don&#39;t see much to argue about. Interestingly, a comic named Jonathan Pie has a great (but very profane) video out on the election and makes basically the same points. Traditionally, part of a Jester&#39;s job description was to remind the King of unpleasant facts. The rant certainly fits in that category.

Of the people I know, you should add another reason:  they can&#39;t tolerate another liberal justice on the Supreme Court and thought it better to elect Trump with his rough edges than to make our highest court dominated by people who think their values are unconstitutional.   The left has paid an extremely high price to enforce progressive values and keep states from enforcing majority values on social issues.<br /><br />While people may believe that Trump would be less militarily adventurous and bring back jobs, the reality is that these are both pretty unlikely.  Leaders with his authoritarian and anti-dialog streak usually end up in armed conflicts.  And his ignorance about actual trade economics makes it pretty likely we will have fewer jobs in America, at least in the short run.<br /><br />You are absolutely right that the left has an irrational tendency to see everything in the lens of sexism and racism when people are really just looking for someone who will fight for their interests.  When the academic and media elites tell rural America about &#39;white privilege&#39;, they reinforce Trump&#39;s message:  &quot;only I will fight for you&quot;.   You can call it racist if you want, but the &quot;cold math&quot; as the blog notes ensures that you won&#39;t get elected telling people they need to set aside their own interests and vote for the interests of people who have it worse than they do.

Thank you for the quiet analysis, I sent links to my friends and family.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Bill Clinton told Hillary&#39;s team that they should give more consideration to rural voters and they laughed at the suggestion.  I think he should have repeated the mantra he had when he was running (It&#39;s the economy, stupid.). It&#39;s not like there wasn&#39;t evidence (http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/01/12/six-years-later-93-of-u-s-counties-havent-recovered-from-recession-study-finds/).<br /><br />I feel like the Democrats couldn&#39;t admit/see that doctoring statistics doesn&#39;t actually fix the problem.   <br /><br />I think the old wisdom used to be that if the economy was going well, the encumbrant party would win,...if not the other party would win.  <br /><br />@JNT+<br />The main difference I see between Fred Haliot and Trump is party structure.  Fred had Brown Shirts in place when he took power, Trump does not have a parallel group at his disposal.  Are some police/military figures sympathetic to Trump, I&#39;m sure there are some, but there would also be many who are not.  Trump is having to fish around for his team, let alone recruiting jack boots.  It&#39;s the guy with the civic group that can replace current police/government systems that will start to pose the real threat.  He might be able to develop a group, but it doesn&#39;t exist now.  I think that is one of the hallmarks to look for.

A political parties primary job is not to change the electorate to focus on the issues it wants (minority rights, social issues or differing economic policies) but focus on the issues its voters care about. <br /><br />A post of interest to this: You Are Still Crying Wolf<br /><br />http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/<br /><br />I like this bit <br />&quot;Stop saying that being against crime is a dog whistle for racism. Have you ever met a crime victim? They don&#8217;t like crime. I work with people from a poor area, and a lot of them have been raped, or permanently disfigured, or had people close to them murdered. You know what these people have in common? They don&#8217;t like crime When you say &#8220;the only reason someone could talk about law and order is that they secretly hate black people, because, y&#8217;know, all criminals are black&#8221;, not only are you an idiot, you&#8217;re a racist.&quot;

It&#39;s a strange world where every day I find myself having more in common with fly over country conservatives than I do with &quot;open minded&quot; liberals.  I&#39;ve lived in the North East my whole life, voted Nader a couple times, Taoist, cut my energy consumption and carbon foot print to maybe 25% the average American, grew up on all of the counter culture elements like punk and metal.  I Voted for Stein for her deep understanding of our imperial foreign policy, a green new deal, and for living in a deep blue state.  But I have to worry if liberals will vandalize my property for supporting a conservative candidate in the future.  I find the decadence and lack of common sense education here disturbing. So much talk and so little lifestyle changing, with as you&#39;ve pointed out Gore being the poster child.  The inability to form cogent arguments from the recent college graduates.  The inability to apply and contrast multiple models/world views to an observation.  <br /><br />Besides the myth of progress many liberal young folk only seem to be able to model human groups by sex or race.  Listen carefully to an interview and you find them trying to stretch legit observations of class struggle,culture clash, or immigration questions into a race or sexism paradigm. Reading the attacks on Stephen Bannon today they&#39;re now trying to stretch him into being a white nationalist.  Many of the authors are in their 20s and seem to not be propagandists but true believers that Trump is a Racist. This is one of the big reasons the old internet culture supported Trump. <br /><br />The general population doesn&#39;t realize that Reddit - the_donald, 295k people strong now, and 4chan /pol/ were doing heavy grassroots lifting for Trump: reading and analyzing massive wikileak dumps, debunking the mainstream media, making memes like no others.  (The joke is its weaponized-autism, i.e., masses of people that will sit on the internet 16 hours a day reading documents like its an obsession)  Trump allies, including the semi-ally Fox, clearly started to pull stories straight from the_donald the last few months.  <br /><br />Tying right in with your myth of progress theme the &quot;internet-right&quot; has a very good concept of the future not being linear.  The running joke on the forum was &quot;because its Current Year&quot;.  There&#39;s numerous clips of people including Trudeau, Clinton, and John Oliver saying &quot;because its 2015/2016&quot; as an answer to policy questions.  The other joke (joke on the internet, serious in real life) response being &quot;because you&#39;re a white male&quot; to shut down discussion.  The social media I follow seems to be doubling down on all that type of rhetoric.  <br /><br />I&#39;ve seen almost zero racism at the_donald.  Most of the people there voted Trump and spents hours every day supporting him because of his stand against the corrupt media, corrupt government, PC culture, and the PCing and liberal take over of the internet.  It&#39;s hard to remember how i found the Archdruidreport 8 or 9 years ago.  Something like Digg-&gt;Reddit-&gt;Zerohedge-&gt;Kunster-&gt;JMG.  There were so many diverse opinions present a decade ago.  Nowadays it would be something like Facebook-&gt;Elon Musk is the greatest and the patriarchy is the root of all problems.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see if 4 years of Trump will break this trend.  I suspect the money will move more towards physical goods producers and that will give them power in the information realm.<br />

JMG - I noticed Eric from upthread already touched on this, but I will reiterate the point; Trump could have attacked the immigration system by approaching the issue in much the same way you did in this post. He could have gone full populist, said &quot;they&#39;re letting the immigrants in to drive down your wages!&quot; and left out the racism. Instead, he went full racist is his very first campaign speech, vilifying and entire people as rapists and murders, and tacking on some populism. <br />In short, while half of the response to this election by the left has been hysterical, I think the fears of minority communities here are more than justified. In my view, it does a disservice to those communities who harbor legitimate concerns to draw a false equivalence between  fears of forced deportation (which Trump has essentially promised) and affluent liberals throwing a fit.

I agree with most of your posts, but I must differ on this one. A the things you faulted the Democrats for failing on would most likely have been enacted if the Republicans had provided even a small bit of support. They couldn&#39;t because of Republican truculence.<br /><br />The things you say Trump promised to change - trade agreements, war drum beating, immigration taking American jobs, elimination of health insurance, etc, are the core objectives of the Republican party. They (Republicans) are going to play clueless Trump like a Patsy to get their objectives accomplished.<br />

Most esteemed Druid, many thanks for your ongoing essays. I&#39;m thinking that one major root of &quot;what&#39;s going on here&quot; is the almost-complete domination of thought in the intelligencia by <b>Ideals</b>, to the exclusion of Reason or even (shudder) Self-Interest, concepts which you&#39;ve discussed previously in this forum. It seems a particularly-sticky trap to fall into thinking that Ideals are the ONLY thing worth considering, in any and all contexts. To me, ideals are an often-attractive frosting on the cake of life, but it strikes me that numerous folks on what we refer to as the Left in the USA and Western Europe have been increasingly insisting that the cake of Society, and even of existence, MUST consist solely of frosting! I&#39;m not at all optimistic that people who have absorbed such ideology can adapt themselves back into a world where Ideals are given their due but are not the dominant, or indeed only, way of interacting with the world and our society. It has certainly been an interesting and slow path to awakening that I&#39;ve followed over the years by reading your blog and questioning my personal assumptions via various means. My personal experience with others who are less &#39;fortunate&#39; in their exposures to the gritty underbelly of human existence does not make me optimistic that the Left will have any sort of &quot;Aha!&quot; moment that frees them from their delusion of Ideals. Within that Left, the seeds of something ominous appear to be germinating. I can only hope that the soil of Reality that those seeds are in will be dry and rocky enough to not nourish those baleful seeds. Best regards.

<p>
JMG,<br /><br />Thanks for another collection of clear thoughts.  If nothing else, this election has forced me to do some hard thinking politically to reconcile my distaste for Trump as a personality with the fact that many of the people supporting him did so for reasons that I can agree with.  <br /><br />There are two points I would like to address.  The first is the racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and general minority-bashing exhibited by an angry, vocal minority of Trump supporters.  At times Trump seemed to condone this behavior, or at least to be glad of their passionate support.  To my friends, this is the greatest barrier to accepting a Trump presidency and even being willing to engage in dialogue with his supporters.  I had a conversation yesterday with a coworker who felt that any conversation discussing the negative effects of illegal immigration had to be motivated by covert racism - the assumption being that it is simply easier to target immigrants as job-stealers than it is to target them directly for the color of their skin.  <br /><br />I think that there is a responsibility on the left to accept that many - the vast majority perhaps - of Trump&#39;s supporters are not supporting him because they are racist or hateful toward one group or another.  I also think there is a responsibility on the right to call out such behavior within their ranks - such as you describe in your own community when the KKK came visiting, but on a larger scale.  I could draw a parallel to the feminist argument that men have a responsibility to call out body-shaming, cat-calling and other such callous male behavior when they see it.  In short, if you find yourself in the same group as people who are doing unacceptable things, and you agree that those things are unacceptable, then you ought to speak out about them to avoid being tarred by a too-broad brush (which in this case is being directed against anyone who voted for Trump).<br /><br />The second point, which I suspect you will address in the future, is that while Trump may have won the election by mentioning a problem that has been carefully avoided by politicians to date (the ongoing economic immiseration of a majority of Americans), the &quot;solutions&quot; that he offers are not going to make any meaningful difference.  In short, the salary class and elite are benefiting from the current state of affairs.  Their current strategy of &quot;distraction at all costs&quot; has reached its pull date, and in its place we are getting Trump&#39;s vision of &quot;call out the problem and offer solutions that appease the masses but won&#39;t affect the elite.&quot;  My exasperation is not so much with voters who identified with Trump&#39;s message; it is with the observation that so many of them believed it.  Rather than targeting policies that allow corporations to pay below minimum wage to undocumented immigrants - an anti-corporate message - he chose to target the immigrants themselves as &quot;rapists and criminals.&quot;  This perpetuates the strategy of redirecting the anger of the lower and middle classes from the logical target of the folks at the top toward the folks at the very bottom who are somehow getting more than they deserve.  <br /><br />Trump has already chosen a Goldman Sachs alumnus as chief strategist, and he is expected to select another as his treasury secretary.  In doing so he will follow in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama.  This may have been a historic election in many ways, but when it comes to the intimate ties between big money and government, nothing is changing at all.  If Trump can&#39;t make the economy grow (and I&#39;m sure he can&#39;t), then his policies only stand to exacerbate wealth inequality in this country.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested, I wrote about this in more length on my blog last night:  http://www.luterra.com/blog/?p=824<br />

For all the reasons you state and more, our family voted for Trump after fervently supporting Bernie. <br />This country is of course marching into a full blown recession. That will be blamed on Trump by the people that helped create it back when Bill Clinton was president, who kept heaping the debt on us, destroying jobs, hoodwinking us into thinking that we could borrow our way to prosperity. <br /><br />A group of us that meet once a week to drink beer and talk about things, sort of a bookclub for guys, without the books, have decided to go on strike to support Trump. <br /><br />We are going to avoid all discretionary purchases until he&#39;s sworn in. Then it&#39;ll be time to buy things we&#39;ve been doing without.

Isaac, your &quot;dreading&quot; of this blog? I appreciate the Freudian slip! ;-)<br /><br />Wes, exactly. Many of the Trump voters I know spoke favorably of Sanders; they didn&#39;t like the label &quot;socialist,&quot; but they liked a lot of his policy stances. I&#39;m pretty sure that if the Dems had nominated him, he would have won with a very solid mandate. <br /><br />RAnderson, no question -- if Trump pulls an Obama and ditches all his campaign promises the moment he&#39;s inaugurated, to quote a certain political figure of the not too distant past, &quot;this sucker&#39;s going down.&quot; And I don&#39;t mean that in a good way. <br /><br />JWN+, not so. Hitler was pounding the antisemitic drums long before he became Chancellor -- the difference, of course, was that antisemitism was socially acceptable in Germany, and indeed throughout the western world, at that time. One of the reasons why Godwin&#39;s Law is so good a tool for ferreting out sloppy thinking is that &quot;Hitler&quot; and &quot;fascist&quot; so often serve as catchall labels meaning next to nothing, other than dislike for whatever&#39;s labeled with them. <br /><br />Drhooves, nah, the Democrats aren&#39;t going to favor wealth distribution. Far too much of the party&#39;s base consists of affluent liberals who have no desire to see their wealth distributed! <br /><br />Five8Charlie, I only know one person who admits she stayed home rather than voting, so I don&#39;t even have a useful sample. I wonder if it would be possible to find out why so many people sat this one out. <br /><br />Mr. Bystander, yes, I&#39;ve read Scott Adams on that; he definitely gets kudos for being one of the few who called it, but I&#39;m less than convinced by his NLP-centric argument. <br /><br />Larry, yes, I&#39;d heard that. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if someone on the Democratic side of things (cough, cough, George Soros, cough, cough) had fantasies of pulling off a color revolution. I wonder if anybody&#39;s thought about what would happen if all those well-armed people in flyover country decided that they had to rally to Trump&#39;s defense...<br /><br />M Smith, thank you. I try to wallop both sides more or less equally; it helps that in most cases, they both richly deserve it.  ;-)<br /><br />Cortes, I have to say I&#39;m baffled by the link you cite. Why shouldn&#39;t a parent hope that their child has a happy sex life, and find the notion of parental ownership of their children rather creepy? <br /><br />David, fascinating. As for the parties, I think both of them are arguably in rigor mortis. What will take their place is another question. <br /><br />O. Douglas, you&#39;re welcome and thank you. <br /><br />Eric, that&#39;s exactly my point. If the Democratic Party remains stuck in their current politics of exclusion and blame, the most likely outcome of the 2020 election will be Trump&#39;s reelection by the kind of landslide that will leave the Democratic Party in the wilderness for a generation. If they&#39;re to have the chance to defend their constituencies, they&#39;ve got to learn to drop the vilification and figure out how to speak to middle America.

HI JMG and all, <br /><br />Looking from the outside, it is an interesting spectacle. People on the &quot;left&quot; are not synonymous with the Clintons and the Democratic party which is Neoliberal, unless left now equals Wall Street and Silicon Valley money + identity politics. The U.S. and most other democracies today are not left/right but up/down - those in the &quot;up&quot; category have to set it up as if there is a left/right (hence identity politics. Imagine if the people were fully aware that there the &quot;up&quot; serves only itself (see Bush&#39;s support of Hillary as an example that busted the left/right open). Even Americans are starting to see through that. People are disoriented and interestingly, Trump is uniquely positioned to shake things up. That is why he was so demonized and frankly, I was shocked he was allowed to win - some cock up somewhere - it took hours for Clinton to concede. Can&#39;t imagine it was fun to get to her to accept that, given how entitled she&#39;s felt all along. <br /><br />One thing I most noticed as I was raised in a dictatorship that maybe some others may not have noticed. Trump&#39;s acceptance speech. He went out of his way to signal that the army is behind him - lists number of generals plus many decorated soldiers. Then he singles out the CIA (who ever mentions the CIA during acceptance speech?)and then the cops. The thing is, North Americans I talked to about this attribute this to law and order agenda. I am not at all convinced. The establishment he went against is extremely powerful - but perhaps Trump has the men with guns. Given the humiliation the various patriots who serve not greed but country, would it be surprising they were behind a strongman who promises to bring a semblance of honour back to the country? Watch him and not for the reasons everyone is discussing.

Eric S., one way or another, Trump promises to be a pivotal figure in American history. If he can consolidate his position by attracting allies from the populist wing of the GOP, and encouraging other populists to run for office, it&#39;ll be his influence that endures; if not -- if his administration turns into one big flustered cluck, or if he crumples and abandons his promises -- it&#39;ll be the reaction to him that becomes the enduring force. Like all such pivotal figures, he is (and will continue to be) a figure of contradictions and ambiguities -- and no matter what happens, there will be people who adore him and people who loathe him, many generations after he&#39;s gone. <br /><br />Please note that I never said he was a plaster saint; his role in American history, like that of all pivotal figures, has nothing to do with moral goodness or with making choices that I like, and everything to do with the resolution, one way or another, of a rising spiral of conflict that has rendered the previous political arrangements unworkable. At best, a lot of people are going to get hurt; at worst, well, my prediction of domestic insurgency and/or civil war here in the US in the next decade or two still stands. It&#39;s possible that a Trump presidency, if he keeps his promises and his policies actually work, will head that off -- but we&#39;ll see. <br /><br />Mark, hmm! I didn&#39;t happen to know that. Merci!<br /><br />Helix, I know. I hope that Trump has the common sense to try to put a brake to that. If not, things could get very ugly indeed. <br /><br />Phil, if the Democrats do that, they&#39;re making the same mistake that the GOP made after Roosevelt&#39;s election in 1932. In 1936, they basically ran on the same platform as before, and convinced themselves they were going to win; with the advantages of incumbency, and millions of voters at his back convinced that he&#39;d made their lives at least a little better, FDR won one of the most spectacular landslide victories in American history, taking every state but Maine and Vermont. It&#39;s unlikely that Trump will do that well, but if the Democrats run another political insider on a platform that consists solely of their idea of business as usual, they&#39;re going to be shellacked. <br /><br />Peter, if you want to insert a different verb in place of &quot;elected,&quot; be my guest. <br /><br />Eric, in the long run, of course, you&#39;re quite correct -- the Long Descent waits for nobody. In the short run -- and 2020 is the short run -- be prepared to be surprised. So much of the economic collapse in flyover country is the product of deliberate policies that benefit the affluent at the expense of everyone else that if Trump manages to get even a good fraction of his proposed policies enacted, things may well get noticeably better for a lot of people in middle America, for a while. Just for a while, but in politics, that&#39;s enough...<br /><br />Isaac, understood. Trump is a crapshoot, and the interesting thing is that a lot of his voters realize that. They voted for him because a vote for Clinton guaranteed the perpetuation of an intolerable status quo. Now we get to see what he actually does. If he backs away from war with Russia, scraps a bunch of trade agreements, and reenacts Glass-Steagall, he&#39;ll have done more good than any of the last four presidents -- but I&#39;m aware that he may also do a lot of harm to a lot of people, and that also has to be weighed in the balance.<br /><br />Moshe, how did Bernie&#39;s write-in vote compare to the minor parties?

Just some anecdotal stuff here.  I&#39;m lower middle class in the Midwest.  I own my own successful small business but find it nearly impossible to get ahead despite doing everything &quot;right&quot;.  My insurance premium on the cheapest form of Obamacare, after subsidies, is shooting from $200 to $1000 per month in 2017.  I am 43, in perfect health, whole foods vegan, no allergies, no pre-existing conditions physical or mental, opted to be sterilized 10 years ago so no biological kids ever, non-drinking, non-smoking, no drugs except for the occasional ibuprofen pill, BMI of 21, regular exerciser including lifting weights, can walk ten miles and barely feel it, and I don&#39;t even get severe colds and flus, total putz, no extreme sports or crazy driving, wear a helmet when biking.  In other words, the ideal insured, paying into a system I never use. So yeah, I&#39;m angry that of all people, I&#39;m being gouged and will be going insurance-free in 2017 because I just can&#39;t manage it financially and also afford food.  <br /><br />That said, I voted against that genocidal maniac who just happens to be another female because I didn&#39;t feel like staring down the barrel of potential nuclear destruction for the next four to eight years.

FiftyNiner, maybe so, but Sanders seems to have come out of all this as the effective leader of the Democratic Party, whoever gets the official label. We&#39;ll see what he does with it. <br /><br />Nancy, er, how is it inaccurate to compare the tantrums of the GOP with those of the Dems? Having lived through several of both, I find them more or less interchangeable. <br /><br />Mark, I think you&#39;ll like the constitutional amendment I&#39;ll be proposing a few posts from now! <br /><br />Varun, that last sentence of yours earns you tonight&#39;s gold star. Exactly; if you want an option that isn&#39;t being offered you by the status quo, you need to get out there and create it. <br /><br />Little Al, of course the wall comment comes across as &quot;hateful,&quot; when you&#39;ve been told by the media over and over again that it can only be taken in that way. That there might be good reasons for a nation to have control of its own borders isn&#39;t a concept the media likes to talk about, you know. <br /><br />Raymond, in the words of Wowbagger the Indefinitely Prolonged, &quot;a being can dream!&quot; <br /><br />Revere, good. It might be enough to pry loose social liberalism from economic neoliberalism, you know. <br /><br />John, the reason I use the term &quot;left&quot; is that it&#39;s the term that a lot of people who support the Democratic Party use for themselves. It&#39;s an abstract label, after all.<br /><br />Will, many thanks for the link, and your memorable summary! <br /><br />Repent, I&#39;m not at all sure Trump will follow Adams&#39; advice! Having a bunch of Portland activists screaming, throwing bricks, and lighting fires to protest his election solidifies his standing in the eyes of the GOP and his own core constituencies, you know. If he simply lets them throw their hissy fit, and goes about the business of getting ready for the inauguration, they&#39;re going to end up looking foolish and he&#39;s going to look calm and statesmanlike. (His restaurant visit last night was more of the same -- a deft way of signaling to his supporters that he despises the press as much as they do.) <br /><br />Keith, if you&#39;re prepping, you should certainly keep doing so; as I noted above, the Long Descent waits for nobody. I do think that if Trump can get Glass-Steagall reenacted, that will help considerably with the banking problem -- you&#39;ll notice that the banking industry was much more stable while that was in place than at any time before or afterwards. Other than that, no argument. <br /><br />Tom, one of the things I find most fascinating about the American left today is that they&#39;re such a case study in the return of the repressed. They think hate is awful, and so of course they label other people as &quot;hateful&quot; and hate them with all their hearts -- all the while insisting that they&#39;re doing no such thing. Jung would have had a field day; talk about projecting those things you can&#39;t stand about yourself onto others...

Thank you John for expanding a compelling case. <br /><br />The worst lesson the democrats might find in this election is that Trump&#39;s presidency will be a disaster over the next 4 years and so they might choose to just let the pendulum swing too far, and trust it&#39;ll swing back, and 2020 we can go back to forgetting about middle America.<br /><br />And even my state of Minnesota only held a weak Democratic vote on a large metro area, but with way too many rural counties going 70%+ Trump, and they had to add an 80% category! And more interestingly Trump barely got more votes here than Romney, but it was Hillary who couldn&#39;t get the votes that Obama did.<br /><br />On your list of issues, I most see #4, &quot;Punishing the Democratic Party.&quot; myself, whether that punishing was done through voting for Trump or not voting at all. And Michael Moore&#39;s TrumpLand, and the bootleg copies explaining the reasoning of the &quot;Rustbelt&quot; a desire to blow up the system, democratic suicide.<br /><br />But whatever degree Clinton was a hawk, no one can seriously consider a Trump presidency will be dovish or isolationist. When Trump says &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, seeing how he sees Muslims and Mexicans, being great to him means finding scapegoats to punish, and even if he doesn&#39;t do any major invasions, bombing will always be popular, like Ted Cruz&#39;s desire to use laser-focused carpet bombing of until the sand glows. <br /><br />And with the Dakota pipeline standoff, you can be nearly sure that a President Trump will be very happy to do some native-bashing, and help the pipeline companies get their way. And its easy to imagine Clinton&#39;s &quot;Deplorables&quot; will be cheering President Trump all the way.<br /><br />And that&#39;s what I really fear. Since President Trump will not be able to &quot;Fix everything&quot; as he claims, the alternative is to identify sequential scapegoats to punish, no matter how unlikely they are the source of any real trouble. <br /><br />One voice I&#39;ve listened to recently is Jonathan Haidt, who first came to attention by observing value systems and seeing Conservatives as having a more balanced set of values, while Liberals too easily got pulled into fairness, and oppression narratives on otherwise ordinary competition. And he sees Social media as a part of our new divide, where no one needs to be isolated, and whatever your grievances, you can find others who will validate them.<br />https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_can_a_divided_america_heal<br /><br />The Right has seemed excited to claim that President Obama has increased racial strife, via movements like BLM, while it is clear that social media is the uniting factor in that. And now White Power movements have been given their light in the sun, and however much Trump says &quot;Stop it&quot;, he set the tone on how to treat people who you disagree with, and that Political Correctness is the enemy and direct expressions of anger and rage are how you get a voice and get power.<br /><br />So you have to think all of this is going to multiply, and each sides transgressions will embolden the other side, and justify further police power to restore &quot;Law and order&quot; and everyone will be painted by their worst behaviors, just like George W. Bush reflected that the Dallas funerals.<br /><br />And we are a country of guns, and many vulnerable people who feel safer with a gun in hand. This can&#39;t end well.

Well written I did not vote for Trump actually voted for none of the above since Jill Stein was not on the ballot here, but war was my number one issue with voting for Clinton. Obama ran on an anti-war platform in 2008, rolled things back, then rescinded, and then quietly expanded war powers. I was pretty much horrified that during the debates both candidates seemed in lockstep support with more endless war and that this stance is not even questioned anymore. But I found Clinton more scary than Trump on this issue she has a clear history of aggression and talked to more failed policies. I have a few liberal friends who have really tried to guilt me about how I&#39;ve failed them personally for not sucking it up and voting for war. Their reaction is making me hope the party self destructs the cognitive dissonance is too much to handle...

Brian, delighted to hear it. I&#39;m not surprised your article covers a lot of the same ground as mine; it&#39;s not actually that hard to read the writing on the wall. <br /><br />Bluebird, of course there&#39;s plenty of intolerance from the right. There&#39;s just as much of it from the left, and just as much hate speech. As I noted in last week&#39;s post, the politics of personal demonization is a problem straight across the political spectrum, and all sides need to stop and think about what they&#39;ve been saying and doing. As for Trump, we&#39;ll see what he actually does; as I noted earlier, if he backs away from confrontation with Russia, tears up some trade agreements, and reenacts some form of Glass-Steagall, he&#39;ll have done more good than any of the last four presidents -- though admittedly that&#39;s a pretty low bar. I&#39;d like to see him begin the process of extracting the US from its imperial entanglements; for reasons I&#39;ll discuss soon in a post, that could spare all of us a lot of grief. <br /><br />Paul, based on what I&#39;ve heard from Trump voters, it&#39;s not a factor at all. Their core concern about mass illegal immigration is that it&#39;s been used to drive down wages and benefits. <br /><br />Rapier, you&#39;re talking as though this abstract label &quot;left&quot; has some inherent meaning. It doesn&#39;t; look into its history, and you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s meant a galaxy of things. I use it because most of the people I&#39;m talking about use it of themselves. <br /><br />Joel, glad to hear that you&#39;re trying to talk to people. The thing is, as a moderate Burkean conservative, I&#39;ve got no stake in either party; the GOP&#39;s stances on most issues are as alien to me as the Democrats&#39; -- but it&#39;s important that neither party has a permanent stranglehold on power, and for that reason I&#39;d like to see the Dems extract their heads from their backsides and stand up for the things that used to win them the support of so many working people of all colors and ethnicities. That was the point of this week&#39;s post, after all! I&#39;m also delighted to hear that the latest issue is out; once I get my copy, I&#39;ll put something at the bottom of the following week&#39;s post. <br /><br />Armata, you&#39;re welcome and thank you. You speak for a lot of people I know in flyover country. <br /><br />Howard, if the Dems double down on a failed strategy, they&#39;re going to get hammered in four years. I&#39;ve been looking over the history of comparable cases in the past, and there are very clear patterns to follow. I wonder if they have anybody who bothers to learn from history...<br /><br />Marxmarv, if Soros et al. think they can drum up a color revolution with the current crop of professional protesters, based on the fairly large sample of the type I knew in Seattle and Ashland, he&#39;s got another think coming. Do you recall what happened in Romania when activists tried to destabilize the Iliescu government in 1990? Iliescu called in the coal miners from the countryside, and there were some very ugly scenes as the activists were beaten and driven out of Bucharest. Think of how many well-armed men and women in the flyover states are Trump supporters, and imagine what would happen if Trump called on loyal American citizens to stop an attempted coup...<br /><br />Justin, I suspect a lot of people stayed home to protest the wretched selection of candidates. As I noted several times before the election, there were easily ten thousand Americans better fitted to be president than Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton was not one of them. <br /><br />DaShui, it&#39;s not an accident that I&#39;ve got plenty of yarrow growing in the back yard. <br /><br />Canon Fodder, no argument at all.

Re: equivalency, recent anyway, I don&#39;t remember McCain/Romney&#39;s natural constituents being shot down in the street; nor either Republican being defeated while getting a majority of the popular vote.  And the complaints about the undemocratic character of the Electoral College have been raised for a loooong time.  (As you know, it was enacted to empower the slave states, who had too few voters (i.e., white folks) vis a vis the northern states, and had to be bribed to sign onto the constitution.)  Equivalency may be fair in some areas, but it is, I think, deadly when asserted in other areas, and far too easy.  <br /><br />Plus, when our attention is so skillfully &#39;contained&#39; in a particular arena, other ideas and possibilities are relegated to the shadows.  This works to the advantage of ... who?  We could be discussing the ingenious National Popular Vote campaign (B Boxer&#39;s bill is a sop); the Chicago Plan (google it); how the &#39;growth imperative&#39; = the inscrutable money creation reality; how modern capitalism would not exist without it&#39;s roots in &#39;wealth creation&#39; via chattel/wage slavery etc... and how our abysmal  ignorance of these, and many other, absolutely critical facts makes us easy prey for the plutocrats. While they fan the emotional flames on both sides. <br /><br />As long as &#39;dramatization&#39; passes for analysis these days, maybe you could write another superb narrative that explicates the economic and monetary reality (and history) as wonderfully as you&#39;ve done with technological possibility in Retrotopia.  :)

I also supported Sanders and believe he would have won easily. I continuously pointed out that Trump was running to Clinton&#39;s left on critically important issues of imperialism, globalism, and economic stagnation. My critique was not well-received in most cases. <br /><br />There is one factor in &quot;support&quot; for Clinton which I don&#39;t think has been given adequate acknowledgement. This is anecdotal, but of three women who detested Clinton but voted for her anyway, all had experienced a &quot;grab her by the&quot; incident. They are uneasy about whether there will be increasing social acceptance of random groping of young women. This behavior is all too common in the U.S., but extremely common in some other countries, so it seems like a realistic fear. I suspect that quite a few Clinton voters were people who could not bring themselves to vote for the Donald for this most visceral reason.

Tolkienguy, I wish I could disagree. One of the reasons I discussed federalism in last week&#39;s post is that I suspect it&#39;s the only viable alternative to the breakup of the Union, with or without civil war. <br /><br />LL Pete, sorry I couldn&#39;t help you with the World Series; I know squat about baseball!<br /><br />Juandonjuan, exactly. We&#39;ve had twenty-four years of neoliberal, globalist, open-borders economics, and the results are in: they produce obscene profits for the already rich and misery for the working class. Now let&#39;s draw the logical conclusions and try something else. <br /><br />WB, maybe we should start a meme that zombies were responsible for Clinton&#39;s loss. They&#39;ve already tried just about everything else...<br /><br />Siliconguy, so noted! You&#39;ve been added to my unscientific data base. <br /><br />Ganv, maybe so, but I think there&#39;s actually a fair chance Trump may actually back away from confrontation with the Russians and improve the job market at least a little. He&#39;s already been on the phone with Putin, and has reiterated that he intends to pursue a less hostile line over Syria -- and so much of the job losses in middle America have been caused by offshoring that terminating the trade agreements that facilitate that, and slapping penalties on companies that do so, might reverse the trend at least a little. But we&#39;ll see. <br /><br />Candace, Bill Clinton could have won this election. I don&#39;t like the man, but he&#39;s a brilliant campaigner and politician, and Hillary is neither. <br /><br />Leo, those first two sentences of yours ought to be put on the business end of a branding iron and applied to some very sensitive backsides. Thank you! <br /><br />Webster, interesting. I&#39;ve had very little direct contact with the internet-right, other than a few people who&#39;ve commented here and flagged their presence by saying &quot;praise Kek&quot; or what have you; by and large, they&#39;ve been more polite, more willing to engage in dialogue, and less prone to spew out thoughtstoppers than their opposite numbers from the left. If you&#39;re right and they aren&#39;t into racism, that&#39;s another plus in their column. <br /><br />Ben, as I&#39;ve said rather more than once -- starting in January -- I&#39;m convinced that Trump&#39;s use of language that the left considers unacceptable was a deliberate choice intended to signal to his main constituencies that he wasn&#39;t a &quot;suit.&quot; His entire strategy was based on distancing himself from the political mainstream, in which politically correct language policing is de rigueur. So no, he couldn&#39;t have done other than he did -- not if he wanted to get the enthusiasm of the abandoned working class voters that he needed to seize the GOP nomination. The lesson I&#39;d suggest you take from that is not that US is awash with racists; it&#39;s that the US is awash with people who have no time for the language policing just mentioned, which is not the same thing. <br /><br />Justin, thanks for the link. <br /><br />Lawrence, um, I think you&#39;re letting partisan loyalty get in the way of reality testing. No, the Democrats weren&#39;t interested in doing the things I listed -- I dare you, for example, to find me any significant number of Democratic politicians who showed the least interest in enforcing the immigration laws. As for your characterization of the GOP, sure -- but Trump does not represent the mainstream of the GOP, which is why so many of them fought him tooth and nail. Look at what the man himself has said, and what he&#39;s still saying he&#39;s going to do, rather than insisting that all Republicans qua Republicans have to fit your stereotype.

One reason people on the Left have felt threatened by Trump supporters is that there have been actual threats directed at them, explicitly linked to the recent sea change in public opinion over whether bigotry is shameful.<br /><br />At least one member of my family has been targeted for this type of harassment. While this wasn&#39;t the beer bottle to the face or the swastika painted on a church that some people had to endure (a partial list <a href="http://fusion.net/story/368783/donald-trump-racist-incidents-attacks/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it was explicitly about her race and was tied to an expected change in Federal policy in addition to an unraveling of norms.<br /><br />People I know from Ireland (including those who have occasionally allowed their visas to lapse for one reason or another) do not receive the same treatment as people who look Mexican but were born in the USA, which makes me think the response would, in fact, be different if the immigration were from Canada.<br /><br />What&#39;s especially sad to me is that the attackers, in general, seem to feel they are breaking free of oppression: that violence, property damage, and threats of violence against groups that seem different were some basic right that they had been denied for decades.<br /><br />I realize an elected official&#39;s policies matter more than their persona, but much of Trump&#39;s portrayal as racist (and Steve Bannon&#39;s flirtation with white nationalist ideology) has helped make this presidential race double as a referendum on political correctness. People are taking liberties with each other on that basis.

I&#39;ve been informed under no uncertain terms that a pogrom is currently underway in America and that because I have not condemned Mr. Trump in the harshest tones, I am personally to blame for massive suffering. :-)<br /><br />A brief rundown on Japan&#39;s reaction to the surprise (note I&#39;m reporting this indirectly, as it is my husband&#39;s chore to keep an eye on the TV, in case it tries anything, so this is filtered via two human beings with their own biases):<br /><br />When it became apparent Trump would win, a few newscasters came out suddenly and started criticizing Clinton on air for her corruption and violence. They&#39;d been holding back because she was the presumed winner. It seemed to be mostly women opening up like this, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of dislike for Clinton among women aware of international affairs, with one commentator a couple months ago saying she disliked Clinton for forgiving her husband&#39;s philandering. <br /><br />The news has subsequently focused on the TPP, which the ruling class and media have highly favored (but a short trip through the countryside, where anti-TPP placards are plastered every which way reveals Japan&#39;s own rural/urban divide). As of yesterday, there was a split among commentators as to whether Japan&#39;s economy would improve or worsen without the TPP. Today there is some talk of Asia going forward with the TPP minus the US.<br /><br />For the first few days after the election they carried some news about violent demonstrations in America, but they are not interested in liberal Americans&#39; reactions to the defeat. They present a generally positive impression of Trump, with a certain amount of dissent, and discuss the ongoing bias in America&#39;s media.<br /><br />None of my students brought up the election results. I taught them Ogden Nash&#39;s &quot;Invocation&quot; (Senator Smoot, Republican, Ut., Is planning a ban on smut). They enjoyed it.<br /><br />A nice sunny day today with a shining Fuji. I went out and shook the kiwi jungle gym to get the ripe ones to fall, and moved the avocado tree up close to our house. <br /><br />Durians are impossible anywhere outside of the tropics, but I am trying to nurse a couple back to health in the greenhouse.<br /><br />Still no frost. Used to occur about a month earlier.<br />

It&#39;s also been interesting to see how quickly the incoming administration got larded up with banking lobbyists, MIC prostitutes, and ridiculous characters like Giuliani and Gingrich. It looks to me like Rust Belt voters are in for a most unpleasant betrayal. I also doubt that the Dems will have enough sense to take advantage of it, since they are likely going to continue with &quot;misogyny and racism lalalala I don&#39;t hear you&quot; to anyone who points out that getting a quarter million from Goldman for a speech is problematic if you claim to represent regular folks.

Bryan, yes, I think that&#39;s an important part of it. I&#39;d also point out, though, that the ideals are being used pretty transparently as camouflage for specific interests; these days, social justice is joined at the hip with predatory neoliberal economics, and the one is used to advance the other -- as when open borders are promoted for humanitarian reasons, but used to drive down wages and benefits. <br /><br />Mark, the problem of the violent minority is present in every corner of American (and not only American) society. Should American conservatives call out the violent minority in their midst? Of course. So should American Muslims, and every other subset of our society that has a violent minority within it. It&#39;s when partisan passions lead various groups to insist that their violent minorities have to be given a free pass while calling for the other side&#39;s to be punished that we get into the kind of mess we&#39;re in today. As for Trump&#39;s solutions, there I disagree, because tearing up the trade treaties that have facilitated offshoring jobs, and enforcing our immigration laws, will very likely improve job prospects for people in the flyover states at least to a modest extent. But we&#39;ll see, of course. <br /><br />Marinhomelander, hmm! I wonder how much impact such a buyers&#39; strike might have, if it spreads beyond your circle of friends. <br /><br />Gabby, some of my readers have noted the number of generals and admirals that supported Trump in the election campaign, and suggested that the military may have backed him as a way to stop Clinton from picking a fight with Russia that the US is arguably far from certain to win. Thus you may be on to something. <br /><br />Herstory, thank you for the data point. I&#39;ve noticed that women especially tended to vote for Trump because of Clinton&#39;s reckless militarism, so you&#39;re far from alone. <br /><br />Rharper, thank you. <br /><br />Ares, there&#39;s a middle ground between empire and isolationism, you know, and I find it entirely plausible that Trump intends to move into that middle ground, away from the current empire-at-all-costs mentality. The insistence that he can&#39;t possibly do so, it seems to me, says more about the way that the Democrats turned him into a cartoon bogeyman than anything else. More generally, I&#39;d encourage you to think about the origins of the scenario you&#39;ve laid out, and compare it to the equivalent scenarios that so many Republicans were waving around to console themselves after their drubbing in 2008. <br /><br />Genevieve, that may just happen. <br /><br />Frank &amp; Jessica, thank you. <br /><br />Nancy, if you go back and reread my post, you might happen to notice that the only equivalency I talked about was the fact that both parties are sore losers, and whiny about it to boot, when they lose the White House. I&#39;m not sure how you leapt from there to the things you&#39;ve talked about in this comment of yours. <br /><br />Roberta, understood. I&#39;m not telling people how to vote, you know -- I&#39;m talking about why a lot of people I know voted the way they did. <br /><br />Barry, it&#39;s as left as we&#39;ve got here! <br /><br />Joel, and of course that&#39;s a valid point. Both candidates helped turn it into a referendum on political correctness, and I think the Clinton campaign wasn&#39;t at all aware of how that part of the vote would go.

Rob, yes, that would also be helpful. <br /><br />Patricia, I loved that Nash poem when I was a child -- it made a splendid chant. &quot;Smite, Smoot, smite for Ut.!&quot; Thanks for the data points. <br /><br />Roberta, granted. To some extent, Trump has to hand out favors to the Republicans who supported him, and to hand out other posts to potential allies within the party, so that he can count on legislative backing for at least some of his agenda. Still, we&#39;ll see. As noted above, if he pulls an Obama and abandons his constituency the moment he gets into office, things may get very ugly very quickly.
